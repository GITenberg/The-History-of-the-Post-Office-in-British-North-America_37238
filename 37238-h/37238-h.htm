<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>My purpose, in the searches for material which led to the
present volume, has been to give as complete an account as it
lay in my power to do, of the beginnings and growth of the
Canadian post office, with which I was associated for thirty-six
years. As my studies progressed, however, I found it would
be necessary to widen my field.</p>

<p>The Canadian post office did not come into being as an independent
organization. It was but the extension into newly-acquired
territories, of a system which had been in operation
for nearly three-quarters of a century, with well-established
modes of administration. Obviously, either reference should
be made to well-known works on the older colonial postal system,
or an account of it must be attempted in this volume.</p>

<p>Although careful studies of some aspects of this history have
been made, this part of colonial history has, on the whole, received
less of the attention of students than has been devoted
to throwing light upon other phases of that history; and, what
was important for my purpose, little has been done in the way
of describing the relations between the colonial postal system
and the general post office in London, to which it was subordinate.</p>

<p>The materials for this portion of the history are to be found
in the records of the general post office, London, the British
Museum, and in the journals of the colonial legislatures. A very
interesting document is Franklin's Account Book, which is in the
Boston Public Library.</p>

<p>The materials for the history of the post office in the provinces
now composing the Dominion of Canada, are in the records of the
general post office, the larger portion of which have been transcribed
for the Public Archives of Canada; in the correspondence
between the colonial governors and the colonial office, which can
be found either in the original or in transcripts in the Public
Archives, and in the Journals of the Provincial Legislatures.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the chapter on the postal service of
Newfoundland, I had the advantage of a rather close acquaintance<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
with that service, due to my having had charge of it some
years ago for a period of several months. The material on which
the chapter is founded has been gathered from the records of the
general post office, and the legislative papers of the colony.</p>

<p>In collecting my material, I have received ready assistance
from all to whom I have applied. To all these my hearty gratitude
is tendered. A word of special acknowledgment is due to Mr.
Edward Porritt, author of <i>The Unreformed Parliament of Great
Britain</i>, who kindly read the manuscript, and to whose experience
I am indebted for many valuable suggestions.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin relates that when the news reached America in
1763 that peace had been concluded between England and France,
he made preparations to visit Canada, for the purpose of extending
to it the postal service of the North American colonies, and that
the joy bells were still ringing when he left Philadelphia on his
journey northward. Franklin has universal fame as a philosopher
and statesman, but is perhaps less widely known as one of the
deputies of the postmaster general of England. He had, however,
a long and useful connection with the post office a quarter of a
century before this time. He was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia
in 1737,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and for many years combined the duties of this
office with that of newspaper publisher. He became deputy
postmaster general in 1753.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Canada had been in the hands of
the British since 1760, and until a regular system of government
was established in 1764, its affairs were administered by a military
council, which among other matters provided a rudimentary postal
service. The merchants of Quebec were desirous of a regular
post office; and, owing to Franklin's promptness, the post office
was the first of the institutions of government which was placed
on a settled footing after Canada became a British province.</p>

<p>On arriving at Quebec, Franklin opened a post office there
with subordinate offices at Three Rivers and Montreal,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and established
a monthly service between the Canadian post offices and
New York, arranging the trips so that the courier should make
as close connection as possible with the packet boats which sailed
monthly each way between New York and Falmouth, England.</p>

<p>The postal system into which Canada was thus incorporated
was of vast extent. It stretched from the river St. Lawrence to
Florida. New York was its pivotal point, the mail couriers running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
north and south connecting there with one another, and with the
packets from England. The system was under the control of
two deputies, of equal authority, one of whom was Franklin, and
the other John Foxcroft. As this system had a long history when
Canada came to be comprised in it, it seems essential to a proper
presentation of the subject that a sketch of that history should
be furnished.</p>

<p>The first notice of a post office in North America appears in
the records of the general court of Massachusetts Bay for the year
1639. The colony was just ten years old. Letters from home,
always eagerly looked for, were then awaited with double anxiety
in view of the distracted state of England.</p>

<p>King Charles was at this time midway in the course of his
great experiment in absolute government, which ten years before
had driven these people from their homes, and ten years later was
to carry him to the block.</p>

<p>Some effective arrangement for the exchange of correspondence
between New and Old England was a necessity. Until 1639 there
was none. On the English side, it was the practice for sea captains,
who intended making a trip to America, to give public notice of
the fact, and to place a bag for the reception of letters in one of
the coffee houses. On the day of sailing, the bag was closed and
taken on board the vessel to America.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the scheme failed. There was no one
in America charged with the duty of receiving and distributing
the letters; and consequently, many letters were misdelivered,
and many not delivered at all. It was to provide a remedy for
this state of things that an ordinance<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was passed on the 5th of
November, 1639.</p>

<p>By this ordinance public notice was given that all letters from
beyond the seas were to be taken to the tavern kept by Richard
Fairbank, in Boston, who engaged that they should be delivered
according to their addresses. He was to receive a penny for every
letter he delivered, and was to answer for all miscarriages due to
his neglect. The Fairbank's tavern was a resort of some prominence.
Through the correspondence of the time, it appears as
the meeting place for various committees of the colony, and returns
to the surveyor general were ordered to be made at Fairbank's
in 1645.</p>

<p>The ordinance of 1639, besides giving directions for the receipt
and delivery of letters coming to Boston from beyond the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
also authorized Fairbank to provide for the despatch of letters
posted at his house, and addressed to places abroad. He was
licensed to receive letters from the citizens of Boston for transmission
across the sea; but the ordinance laid it down carefully
that "no man shall be compelled to bring his letters thither unless
he please."</p>

<p>This proviso is quite in keeping with the spirit of the time.
At present and for more than two centuries past, the exclusive
right of the post office to engage in the conveyance of letters is
conceded without question. But at that time, its claims to a
monopoly in letter carrying were contested on all sides.</p>

<p>Indeed anything presenting the appearance of a monopoly
found small favour. The natural jealousy with which every claim
to exclusive privilege is viewed, was heightened to the point of
hatred during the struggle for constitutional government, by the
fact that trading monopolies which were granted to courtiers, not
only enhanced unreasonably the price of many of the necessities
of life, but also furnished the means, which enabled the king to
pursue his illegal and arbitrary courses in defiance of parliament.</p>

<p>The privy council in England had adopted in 1635 a scheme for
the administration of the post office, one of the features of which
was the bestowal upon it of the sole right to carry on the business
of conveying and delivering letters in England. This was contested
in the courts, and in 1646 was pronounced illegal.</p>

<p>The claim had received an earlier blow at the hands of the
long parliament, which in 1642 condemned the post office monopoly.
The arguments for monopoly, however, were not long to
be gainsaid; and when Cromwell took up the question of the post
office, and passed a comprehensive act on the subject in 1656,
the monopoly as regards the conveyance of letters was conferred
on the post office in express terms.</p>

<p>This act was confirmed after the Restoration in 1660; and the
post office has remained undisturbed in the enjoyment of its monopoly
since that date. In the North American colonies, the post
office monopoly was never popular, though, owing to the ease with
which it was evaded, it was regarded with indifference until close
upon the war of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In 1663, the English government began to see the necessity
for a postal service between England and its colonies in America.
On the 1st of June of that year, the king wrote to the governor of
Barbados<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that it had become a matter of daily complaint that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
there was no safe means of communication with Virginia, New
England, Jamaica, Barbados and other colonies in America; and
he directed the governor to establish a post office within Barbados
and the Caribbee Islands.</p>

<p>The post office was to be under the control of the postmaster
general of England, to whom the accounts should be sent; and
the rates of postage were to be the same as those fixed for England
by the act of 1660. Nothing seems to have been done at this time
towards establishing a post office in either Virginia or New England.</p>

<p>So far as the interests and convenience of the people of New
England were concerned, these in no way suffered from the lack
of attention on the part of the home government. The coffee
house on the one side, and the tavern on the other, with the vessels
passing between as often as business warranted, answered every
reasonable demand.</p>

<p>In Virginia it would not appear that the legislature at this
period took any steps towards providing a place of deposit and
delivery, such as Fairbank's, for letters passing between the
colonists and their correspondents beyond the sea. But the want
of this convenience caused little restriction on the exchange of
letters by means of the trading vessels which visited Jamestown.</p>

<p>New York contained the only other considerable group of
settlers at this time. It was a recent acquisition, having passed
into the hands of the English in 1664. The Dutch, the former
possessors, had arrangements for the exchange of letters with
Amsterdam, not dissimilar from those in force in New England.
In 1652 the Dutch West India Company informed their director
general in New Amsterdam, that having observed that "private
parties give their letters to this or that sailor or free merchant,
which letters to their great disadvantage are often lost through
neglect, remaining forgotten in the boxes or because one or the
other removes to another place," they had a box hung up at their
place of meeting in which letters might be deposited for despatch
by the first vessel sailing; and they directed that the same step
might be taken in New Netherland.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Seven years later, finding that the people of New Netherland
persisted in disregarding the measures taken for the safety of their
letters, the company repeated their order, and reinforced it by a
fine of one hundred Carolus guilders for each infraction.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>For some years after 1664, the trade between England and its
new possession was of small proportions, and the opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
for sending letters from one to the other, few. Lord Cornbury,
as late as 1702,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> informed the Lords of Trade that there were so few
vessels running between New York and ports in England that he
had to depend for his correspondence on Boston or Philadelphia,
which places had regular communication with the mother country.</p>

<p>Nor was the case of New York materially improved in 1708.
Cornbury, in that year, pleaded with the board of trade for a
regular packet service to some part of the American continent.
Sometimes many months elapsed, without his hearing in any way
from home. Before he received his last letters in May, he had heard
nothing from England for fifteen months.</p>

<p>There were but two safe ways of sending letters to England,
which were the Virginia fleet, and the Mast fleet of New England.
From Virginia there was no post, and it was very hard to know
when that fleet would sail. From Boston there was a post by
which Cornbury could hear once a week in summer, and once a
fortnight in winter, so that they had a sure conveyance by the
Mast fleet. Advantage had to be taken, as opportunity offered,
Cornbury informed the board of trade, of the packets running
from the West Indies to England, but as several of the packet boats
had been captured, this was a very uncertain mode of communication.</p>

<p>But, although the three groups of colonies had each its own
connection with England, until 1672 there was no connection
whatever between these groups. Nor was any thought to be
necessary. The groups were separated from one another not only
by space, but by social and political differences.</p>

<p>The Puritans of New England and the Cavaliers of Virginia,
had little in common but the memories of a quarrel, which was
still warm; and New York was still largely Dutch, though even
at that date it was taking on the cosmopolitan character, which
has since distinguished it.</p>

<p>As for the trade of the colonies, Mr. Woodrow Wilson stated&mdash;"the
main lines of trade run straight to the mother country, and
were protected when there was need by English fleets. Both the
laws of parliament and their own interest bound the trade of the
colonies to England. The Navigation Act of 1660 forbade all
trade with the colonies except in English bottoms; forbade also,
the shipment of tobacco any whither but to England itself; and
an act of 1663 forbade the importation of anything at all except
out of England, which it was then once for all determined must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
be the entrepôt and place of staple for all foreign trade. It was
the Dutch against whom these acts were aimed."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>As has happened so often, however, that which could not be
accomplished by reason of the feebleness of the common interest
was brought about by the presence of impending danger. In
1672, war broke out between the English and the Dutch, the object
of which was maritime supremacy and colonial expansion. The
stakes were the colonies in Africa, the East Indies, the West Indies
and America.</p>

<p>The English having ousted their rivals from New York presented
a strong front on the North American continent; and the only
thing lacking was cohesion among the several colonies. At the
outbreak of the war, the king directed governor Lovelace, of
New York, to see what could be done towards establishing a regular
postal communication between the colonies.</p>

<p>Lovelace arranged for a monthly service by courier between
New York and Boston.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> There was no road between the two
places; and governor Winthrop was asked to provide an expert
woodman, who would guide the courier by the easiest road.</p>

<p>The courier was directed to blaze the route, and it was hoped
that a good road might be made along the route pursued. The
courier made his trips for a few months only, when New York was
captured by a Dutch fleet which came suddenly upon it. The
town was restored to the English at the conclusion of the war in
1674, and with the disappearance of the danger, the communication
also was dropped.</p>

<p>A few years later danger of a more serious character threatened
from another quarter, and again the colonies were compelled to
recognize the necessity of yielding something from the attitude
of jealous independence, which characterized them. Between the
English colonies and the French in Canada there was a steady
rivalry for the possession of the fur trade of the Western country.
Each had Indian allies, whose methods of warfare carried terror
among their opponents.</p>

<p>The English were in numbers very much superior to the French;
and if united and determined could have overwhelmed them. The
unwillingness of the English to take any action in common was
costing them dearly, as the outlying parts of all the colonies were
being constantly harassed by the Indian tribes in league with the
French.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1684 a conference took place at Albany between the representatives
of the several colonies and of the Iroquois nations.
This conference was important in several respects, but particularly
in the fact that it was the first in which all the colonies took part.
Even remote Virginia sent a delegate.</p>

<p>While the colonies were in this mind, Colonel Dongan, governor
of New York, determined to make an effort to establish a permanent
postal service among them. His plan was to establish a line of
post houses along the coast from the French boundaries to Virginia.
The king, who was much pleased with the proposition, directed
Dongan to farm out the undertaking to some enterprising contractor,
for a period of three or five years, and to turn over at
least one-tenth of the profits to the Duke of York.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The duke appears to have had a claim on the revenues of the
post office on two grounds. He was proprietor of the colony of
New York; and under the post office act of 1660, he was recognized
as entitled to a share in the profits from the English post office.</p>

<p>How far Dongan succeeded with this extensive scheme does
not appear. He planned to visit Connecticut, Boston, and, if
possible, Pemaquid. In March 1685, he had an ordinance adopted
in the council of New York for a post office throughout the colonies,
and fixed the charges for the conveyance of letters at threepence
for each hundred miles they were carried, and for the hire of horses
for riding post, threepence a mile.</p>

<p>Dongan's jurisdiction did not, however, extend beyond the
colony of New York; and the records of the other colonies are
silent as to their acquiescence in this arrangement. The only
evidence that has appeared as to the operation of the service,
and it establishes the fact that the service was performed for a
time at least, is that Leisler, an insurrectionary leader, who seized
the government of the colony in 1689, arrested the mail carrier
on his way from New York to Boston, and confiscated his letters.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In July 1683, a weekly post was established in Pennsylvania.
Letters were carried from Philadelphia to the Falls of Delaware
for threepence; to Chester for twopence; to New Castle for fourpence;
and to Maryland for sixpence.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>As part of the scheme of James II for the confederation of the
New England States under a royal governor, a postmaster was
appointed for the united colonies. The choice fell upon Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Randolph, who had just previously been made secretary and registrar
of the new province. The appointment was dated 23rd of
November, 1685.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He seems to have discharged the duties of postmaster<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
until the fall of the Andros government, which followed
closely the deposition of James II in 1689.</p>

<p>Until this time, then, the post office would be classed generally
among the merely temporary conveniences of the state, and not
among its permanent institutions. When William III was settled
on his throne, he managed, amid his cares at home and abroad,
to give some attention to the affairs of the colonies. Those in
North America had been growing rapidly, and at the end of the
period of the revolution in England, the population is believed to
have been about 200,000.</p>

<p>The greater part of the increase was in the middle states of
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania; though in the south,
the colonies of Maryland and Virginia showed considerable gain,
and a beginning was made in the settlement of the Carolinas.</p>

<p>The question of providing the American colonies with a postal
system was submitted to the king by Thomas Neale, Master of the
Mint, who coupled his representations on the subject with a petition
for authority to establish such a system in America at his own
charges. He pointed out in his memorial that there had never
been a post for the conveying of letters within or between Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, New York, New England, East and West
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and northward as far as the king's dominions
reach in America; and that the want thereof had been a great
hindrance to the trade of those parts.</p>

<p>The king thereupon, on the 17th of February, 1691, granted a
patent to Neale, conferring upon him authority to set up one or
more post offices in each of the chief ports of the several islands,
plantations and colonies in America, and to carry on all the functions
of postmaster, either in person or by deputy. He might
collect as his own, the postage accruing from the business, the rates
being fixed by the English post office act of 1660; or he was at
liberty to charge such other rates "as the planters and others will
freely agree to give for their letters or packets upon the first settlement
of such office or offices."</p>

<p>In order to secure to Neale a monopoly of the postal business,
the patent imposed a prohibition on any person except Neale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
from setting up post offices during the term of the patent, which
was twenty-one years. Neale was held bound to provide an efficient
service; in case of dissatisfaction, or of his failure to put the service
in operation within two years, the patent was to become invalid.
The consideration that Neale was to give for the patent was merely
nominal; he was to remit six shillings and eightpence to the
exchequer each year at the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel.</p>

<p>Having secured his patent, Neale sought a suitable person
to act as his deputy. His choice fell upon Andrew Hamilton,
an Edinburgh merchant, who after seven years' residence in New
Jersey, was made governor of that province in 1692. Hamilton
was a man of energy and ability; and in the difficult task of conciliating
sensitive legislatures, and bringing them into agreement
with his views, he had much success. It was to him that the colonies
were indebted for their first effective postal system.</p>

<p>Neale's patent did not give him power to set up a postal service,
and fix his charges without regard to the will of the people. He
might either apply the rates fixed by the act of 1660; or come to
terms with the people or their representatives as to the rates they
would agree to pay. The latter was the alternative chosen.</p>

<p>Accordingly, during the year 1693, Hamilton addressed himself
to the several colonial governments, setting forth his plan, and
begging that they might "ascertain and establish such rates and
terms as should tend to quicker maintenance of mutual correspondence
among the neighbouring colonies and plantations, and
that trade and commerce might be better preserved."</p>

<p>The colonies having responded favourably to his overtures,
Hamilton prepared a draft bill, which he submitted to the legislatures
for their acceptance. This bill provided for a general post
office or chief letter office in the principal town of each colony,
the postmaster of which was to be appointed by Hamilton. The
monopoly conferred on Neale by his patent was enforced in the
proposed bill by considerable penalties for infringements.</p>

<p>The postal charges, as well as the privileges and appurtenances
to be granted to post masters and mail couriers, were discussed
between Hamilton and the several legislatures. There was some
variety in the privileges allowed to postmasters and couriers. In
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, the mail couriers
were granted free ferriage over the rivers and other water courses
which lay along their routes. In the acts passed by New York
and New Hampshire, there was no mention of free ferries, but in
each of these acts a rather peculiar exemption is made in favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the postmasters, that they should not be subject to excise charges
on the ale and other liquors which formed the stock in trade of
their business as innkeepers.</p>

<p>The postmasters in all the colonies were made exempt from
all public services, such as keeping watch and ward, and sitting
on juries. Shipmasters on arriving at a port with letters in their
care were enjoined to deliver them to the nearest post office, where
they would receive one halfpenny for each letter.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The principal postal rates, as settled between Hamilton and the
legislatures concerned were as follows: on letters from Europe or
from any country beyond sea, if for Massachusetts, New Hampshire
and Pennsylvania twopence; if for New York ninepence. In the
interchange among the colonies themselves, the charge on a letter
passing between Boston and Philadelphia was fifteen pence, and
between New York and Philadelphia fourpence-halfpenny.</p>

<p>There was a peculiarity in the postage on letters passing between
Boston and New York. It differed according to the direction
the letter was conveyed. A letter from New York to Boston cost
twelvepence; while ninepence was the charge from Boston to
New York. This is one of the consequences of the separate negotiations
carried on by Hamilton with the different legislatures.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts act fixed the charge on the letters for delivery
in Boston; and the New York act on the letters for New York.
From Virginia, to Philadelphia, New York and Boston, the charges
were ninepence, twelvepence and two shillings respectively. All
the acts concurred in the stipulation that letters on public business
should be carried free of charge.</p>

<p>The foregoing contains the substance of the acts passed by
New York and Pennsylvania. Massachusetts went a step further.
To that legislature it appeared desirable to put a binding clause
requiring Hamilton to give a satisfactory service. Massachusetts
was as willing as the others to grant a monopoly of letter carrying
to Hamilton, but it was of opinion that the exclusive privilege
should carry an obligation with it. The postal service was being
established as a public convenience; and if Hamilton was to have
the power to prevent any person else from providing the convenience,
he should be bound to meet the public requirements himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The Massachusetts legislature, after authorizing Hamilton
to settle a post office in Boston, fixing the postal charges, and conferring
a monopoly on him, accordingly added a clause binding
Hamilton to maintain constant posts for the carriage of letters to
the several places mentioned in the act; to deliver the letters
faithfully and seasonably; and it imposed a fine of £5 for
each omission.</p>

<p>In order that the public might be in a position to detect any
delays in the delivery of letters after they reached a post office,
the postmaster was required to mark on each letter the date on
which it was received at his office. New Hampshire followed
Massachusetts in adding this clause to its post office acts.</p>

<p>The four acts were sent to London, and laid before the king
in council, as all colonial acts were. The acts of New York, Pennsylvania
and New Hampshire passed council and became law.
On the advice of the governors of the post office, the Massachusetts
act was disallowed.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The grounds for the discrimination against Massachusetts are
difficult to understand. The Massachusetts act undoubtedly
contained departures from the terms of the patent. But they
were such departures as might be expected when an act is drawn
up, by a person unlearned in the law, who, having the patent
before him, aims at substantial rather than at literal conformity
therewith. There can be no question that the drafts presented
to the several assemblies were prepared by one person. Their
practical identity establishes the fact.</p>

<p>There can be equally little doubt that the draftsman was Hamilton
himself. The governors of the post office, who framed the
objections,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> noted first that the patent provided that the appointment
of Neale's deputy should, at his request, be made by the
postmaster general; whereas the Massachusetts act appeared to
appoint Andrew Hamilton postmaster general of the colonies,
independently of the postmaster general of England, and not
subject to the patent.</p>

<p>The patent required Neale to furnish accounts at stated intervals
to enable the treasury to establish the profits from the enterprize.
It also stipulated for the cancellation of the patent in certain
eventualities. Both these terms are omitted from the act. Insufficient
care was taken in safeguarding the post office revenue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and no provision was made for a successor in case of the removal
of Hamilton from his position.</p>

<p>The points to which the post office drew attention were, as
will be seen, far from wanting weight; and if they had not been
pressed against the Massachusetts bill alone, would have excited
little comment. But the Massachusetts general court noted and
resented the discrimination. When Neale was informed of the
disallowance, he begged the governors of the post office to prepare
a bill which they would regard as free from objections, and to
lend their efforts to have it accepted by Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>A bill was drawn up; and Lord Bellomont, the governor of
New England, was instructed to invite the favourable consideration
of the Massachusetts legislature to it.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The bill was laid before
the general court on June 3, 1699, and it was ordered to be transcribed
and read.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Five days later it came up for consideration, but it was resolved
that the committee on the bill should "sit this afternoon,"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
it appeared in the assembly no more. The rejection of the bill,
however, was of little or no practical consequence. The post office
was too great a convenience to be refused; and so it was established
and conducted as if the bill were in operation, except that it had
no monopoly in that colony.</p>

<p>But the legislature, which was evidently desirous of extending
in its own way all reasonable aid to Hamilton, passed an order
in 1703<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> requiring shipmasters to deliver all letters they brought
with them from oversea at the post office of the place of their
arrival, for which they were to receive a halfpenny each from the
postmaster. Massachusetts equally with the other colonies made an
annual grant to the post office for the conveyance of its public letters.</p>

<p>So far the narrative deals only with the northern colonies.
The proposition for a post office, however, was submitted to Virginia
and Maryland as well. It would seem, however, that the mode
of approaching these governments differed from that taken in
laying the proposition before the northern colonies. In case of
the northern colonies Hamilton dealt with the legislatures in person.
The draft bill which he prepared was submitted as a basis for
discussion. So far as it went it was accepted, and Hamilton agreed
to such additions as the legislatures considered necessary in view
of local circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia and Maryland were approached quite differently.
They were advised of the scheme not by Hamilton, but by the
English court. In the minutes of council of both governments,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
it is recorded that the proposition was laid before them in a letter
from the queen. This fact will account for the very different
consideration the proposition received from these colonies. Maryland
rejected it outright. On the 13th of May, 1695, the scheme
was laid before the house of burgesses. It was set aside,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and nothing
more was heard of it.</p>

<p>Virginia gave attentive consideration to the proposition to
establish a post office, though the ultimate results were no greater
than in Maryland. There had been since 1658 an arrangement
for the transmission of letters concerning the public affairs of the
colony.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> An order was issued by the council that all letters superscribed
for the public service should be immediately conveyed from
plantation to plantation to the place and person directed, and that
any delay should subject the person at fault to a fine of one hogshead
of tobacco.</p>

<p>No arrangements of a systematic nature were made for the
conveyance of private letters. When information of the patent
granted to Neale reached Virginia, the colony showed immediate
interest. The council on the 12th of January, 1693, appointed Peter
Heyman deputy postmaster,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and proceeded to draw up a post
office bill. This bill, which became law on the 3rd of April 1693,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
authorized Neale to establish a postal system in the colony, at
his own expense.</p>

<p>The conditions were that he was to set up a general post office
at some convenient place, and settle one or more sub-post
offices in each county. As letters were posted in the colony
or reached it from abroad, they were to be forthwith dispersed,
carried and delivered in accordance with the directions they bore,
and all letters for England were to be despatched by the first ship
bound for any part of that country.</p>

<p>The rates of postage were to be threepence a single letter within
an eighty mile radius; fourpence-half penny for single letters outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the eighty mile radius; and eighteen pence for each ounce weight.
Public letters were to pass free of postage. No provision was made
for postage on letters addressed to places beyond the boundaries
of the colony; and it was expressly stipulated that the act did
not confer a monopoly on Neale. Merchants were not restrained
by this act from employing the services of shipmasters and others,
to carry their letters abroad.</p>

<p>The Virginia act of 1693 was local in its scope and provincial
in its character. There is a certain simplicity in the extent of
its demands as compared with the paucity of its concessions.
Neale, at his own cost, was to establish a postal system, comprising
a general post office at a place agreed upon, and one or more subordinate
offices in each county. Couriers were to be available
to take letters anywhere within the colony&mdash;without postage if
on public business, at rates fixed by the colony if they were
private letters. But no person need employ the post office, should
any other more convenient or cheaper mode of conveyance offer
itself.</p>

<p>A post office, like other kindred accommodations, creates
business for itself; but Virginia did not intend that Neale should
have any assurance of the business he had brought into existence.
As soon as it reached a point at which it was worth struggling for,
a competitor might step in and deprive Neale of the fruits of his
enterprise.</p>

<p>The act of 1693 seems to have been adopted before the colonies
were made aware of Hamilton's connection with the American
post office. When the council of Virginia were advised of Hamilton's
appointment, they opened communication with him. The
notes of the correspondence as they appear in the minutes of council<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
do not give much information, but they show that Hamilton's
proposition when submitted to council was not found acceptable;
and as subsequent communications failed to remove the difficulties,
matters remained as they were until after the Neale patent had
expired.</p>

<p>In 1710, the subject was reopened, and the governor reported
to the board of trade, that for two months past he had been expecting
Hamilton to visit Virginia, for the purpose of opening a post
office, and connecting it with the other colonies. The governor
believed that the scheme was feasible, and would do his utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to encourage it. He foresaw a difficulty in the lack of small currency,
tobacco which was the only specie, being in the governor's
words "very incommodious to receive small payments in, and of
very uncertain value."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The line of posts established by Hamilton extended from Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, to Philadelphia. Over this long line,
couriers travelled with the mails weekly each way.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The volume
of correspondence carried cannot be ascertained, as the great
mass of it, being on public business, would be free of postage.
But the postage collected throughout North America during the
first four years, from 1693 to 1697, was only £1456 18<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, an
average receipt of considerably less than £400 a year.</p>

<p>By way of comparison it may be noted that, in 1693, the revenue
between London and Edinburgh was £500; and it was explained
that nearly the whole of that amount was for government despatches.
The expenses of the Portsmouth-Philadelphia service during those
years were £3817 6<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The deficit of £2360 8<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> fell upon
Neale. Results such as these would be sufficiently discouraging.
But Neale and his deputy, Hamilton, were hopeful, and drew comfort
from the fact that the revenue of New York which was quite
insignificant the first year had doubled itself in the third year.</p>

<p>At the end of the sixth year, the revenue had increased to the
point at which all the expenses were met, except Hamilton's salary.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
In 1699, Hamilton went to England, and joined Neale in an appeal
to the treasury.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> After pointing out the benefits accruing to the
colonies from the post office&mdash;the increase in the transatlantic
and intercolonial trade, the rapid diffusion of intelligence in time
of war, and the facilities afforded for the delivery of public letters&mdash;they
declared that unless steps were taken to secure to them the
transmission of the whole, and not a mere portion of the oversea
correspondence, they might be compelled to abandon the undertaking.</p>

<p>The plan Neale and Hamilton proposed to this end, was to put
a stop to the collection of letters at the English coffee houses, and
to compel the shipmasters to take all their letters from the local
post office, where they would be made up in sealed bags.</p>

<p>Besides ensuring to Neale, by this means, the postage on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the correspondence passing between the mother country and the
colonies, the measure proposed would prevent certain abuses which
were incident to the existing arrangement. Where the bag hung
open in a coffee house, any person might examine its contents
on the pretext that he wanted to get his own letter back, and when
the ship had reached its destination it was the practice of some
captains to delay the delivery of the letters in their hands until
they are ready to sail again, and then they got rid of their letters in
any way they could.</p>

<p>If the mails were made up in post offices, and the captains were
compelled by law to deliver them to the post office at the port of
destination before they broke bulk, these evils would be corrected,
and a large revenue now lost to the post office would be saved.</p>

<p>Neale and Hamilton also submitted a revised tariff of postal
charges, in which there was a general increase. The postmasters
general in England rather deprecated the increased postal rates,
stating that experience had taught them that low rates were found
to be more productive of revenue than those which placed the
post office beyond the reach of the mass of the people. They
approved of the suggestion that post offices should be established
in England for the handling of oversea mails, and hoped that a
few years of good management would make the service a remunerative
one.</p>

<p>At this point the postmasters general in London threw out a
suggestion, which was worth discussion. They doubted whether
a post office in private hands would ever commend itself to the
colonies in the same way as if it were directly in the hands of the
king. The post office depended for its prosperity on the maintenance
of its monopoly, a thing naturally distasteful. The monopoly
was easily evaded, even if the colonial governments supported
it heartily, but any lack of inclination on their part would leave
it valueless. They were of opinion that it would require all the
authority possessed by the king to induce the colonial governments
to co-operate with the heads of the post office in the efforts of the
latter to put the service on a sound footing.</p>

<p>Neale, who was sinking deeper and deeper into debt, seized on
this expression of opinion, and offered to surrender his patent
at any time, on such consideration as seemed just. The treasury,
however, were not yet ready to take over the American posts, but
they directed the postmasters general to give Hamilton every
assistance in their power, and requested the governors of the colonies
to do the same, adding that when the value of the post office could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
be ascertained, they would give the question of the resumption
of the patent, further consideration.</p>

<p>Neale's indebtedness to Hamilton for salary now amounting
to £1100, he assigned his patent to Hamilton, and to one Robert
West, who had made some advances to Neale some years before.
The new patentees besought the government to extend their term,
which in ordinary course would expire in 1712. Their confidence
in the eventual success of the scheme, however, suggested to the
postmasters general that the time was now ripe for the crown
to take back the patent, and manage the postal service through the
general post office in England.</p>

<p>The transfer was made; and John Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> son of the founder
of the American post office, who died in 1703, was entrusted with
the management of the service, as the deputy of the postmaster
general. The results were no better than when the service was
privately administered. In 1709, there was a yearly deficit of
£200; and as the queen would not allow her losses on this head to
be augmented, the postmasters were not being paid.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The postmaster of New England made a strong representation
to the government of Massachusetts, pointing out that he had
received nothing from the government since 1706, although he
had saved the colony £150 a year by the delivery of the public
letters. The remonstrance was fruitless, and he renewed his
application in 1711. The legislative council on each occasion
was prepared to pay what was due to the postmaster, but the
assembly could not be brought to authorize it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Colonial post office under Queen Anne's act&mdash;Early packet service.</p></div>


<p>For some years various circumstances had been arising which
made it necessary that the post office in Great Britain and the
colonies should be established on a footing different from that on
which it then stood. The legislative union between England and
Scotland in 1707 called for a uniform postal service throughout
Britain; but without additional legislation the postmaster general
of England could not dispose of the revenues of the post office in
Scotland.</p>

<p>The colonies were in their infancy when the English law of
1660 was enacted, and they were not mentioned in it at all. The
only clause in that act which affected the colonies in any way was
that which required all masters of ships who brought letters with
them from beyond the seas, to deposit them at the nearest post
office. There was no penalty attached to the disregard of this
clause, and the attempt to induce the shipmasters to obey the law
by paying them a penny for every letter they delivered in the
English post office was pronounced by the auditors to be illegal,
and there was a threat made that these payments would be disallowed
in the accounts.</p>

<p>There were a number of other circumstances arising out of the
growth of the kingdom and its colonial expansion, which compelled
the postmaster general to take action in advance of legal authority.
When the treasury, after the union of England and Scotland,
learned that a new post office law was necessary, they determined
to take advantage of the fact to serve their own purposes. The
war of the Spanish Succession, which began in 1702, while ruinous
to France, also seriously crippled England; and the treasury
saw that the enactment of a new post office act might be utilized
to increase the postal charges, and additional sums raised for
carrying on and finishing the war.</p>

<p>In 1710, accordingly, a post office bill was presented to parliament.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
It was passed by parliament; and this act was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
measure which dealt in a comprehensive way with the British
post office. Substantially it was the law of the post office for more
than a century afterwards.</p>

<p>The effect of the new law on the colonial post office was profound.
Until 1710 the terms and conditions under which the post
office in the colonies was operated, were matters of arrangement
between Hamilton and the several legislatures. While the Neale
patent enabled Hamilton to set up post offices in the colonies,
the postal charges were fixed by the colonial legislatures at such
rates as "the planters shall agree to give."</p>

<p>The Neale patent had been resumed by the crown in 1706, but
not abrogated. Hence, until the new act came into force, the crown
simply stood in the place of the patentees, and operated under
the legislation agreed upon between Hamilton and the colonial
governments. New York and Pennsylvania, as their short term
acts expired, renewed them with the crown; and New Jersey,
which established a postal system in 1709, fixed the rates of postage
by act of the legislature, but placed the management of the service
in the hands of the postmaster general.</p>

<p>The post office act of 1710 made it no longer necessary to
consult the colonial legislatures as to the charges to be made for
the conveyance and delivery of letters in North America. The
supreme control of the postal system throughout the British
dominions, beyond the sea, as well as at home, was vested in the
postmaster general of England. The rates of payment were fixed
by the act, and the mode in which the surplus revenues were to
be disposed of was set forth in the same enactment.</p>

<p>In America, the general post offices at Boston, New York and
Philadelphia, which stood quite independent of one another, were
reduced to the rank of ordinary offices, and made parts of the
system, the headquarters of which were placed by the act in New
York.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The administration of the system, as reconstructed, was
continued in the hands of John Hamilton.</p>

<p>As in all other parts of the British dominions, the rates of
postage were sensibly increased.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Under the Neale patent, a letter
from New York for Philadelphia cost fourpence-halfpenny. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
act of Queen Anne raised the charge to ninepence, just double the
former rate. A letter posted in Boston, and addressed to Philadelphia,
which under the Neale patent cost for postage fifteen
pence, cost twenty-one pence under the act of 1710. But these
figures give no adequate idea of the magnitude of the postal
charges as fixed by the act of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>An explanation of the system to which these rates applied
will make the matter clearer. At the present time the postage on
a letter passing anywhere within the British Empire, or from
Canada to any part of the United States or Mexico, is two cents
per ounce weight, whether the letter is addressed to the next town
or to the farthermost post office in the Yukon.</p>

<p>In 1710, and indeed in Canada until 1851, the distance a letter
was carried was an element which entered into the cost. It
would have been thought no more proper to ignore the element
of distance in fixing the postage on a letter than in fixing the
charge for the conveyance of a parcel of goods. By the act of
1710 the postage on a single letter passing between two places
sixty miles apart or less was fourpence; where the places were
from sixty miles to one hundred miles apart the charge was sixpence.</p>

<p>Besides the distance, however, there was another factor which
helped to determine the amount of the postage. This factor will
appear from a description of the classes into which letters were
divided.</p>

<p>Letters were single, double, and treble, and ounce. A single
letter was one consisting of one sheet or piece of paper, weighing
less than one ounce. If with this single sheet letter, a piece of
paper was enclosed, no matter how small, the letter was called a
double letter. The treble letter was a letter consisting of more
than two sheets or pieces of paper, under the weight of an ounce.</p>

<p>Whatever the postage of a single letter might be, the postage
on a double letter was equal to that of two such single letters;
and that on a treble letter was three times that on a single letter.
There were no envelopes in use at this period, and the sheet on
which the letter was written was so folded that an unwritten
portion came on the outside, and on this space the address was
written.</p>

<p>The question will occur as to how the presence of enclosures
could be detected among the folds of the larger single sheet. There
were several means of detection born of ingenuity and experience.
The approved method and the one long in service, was to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
every letter up to a lighted candle, and by some skilful manipulating,
the taxable enclosures could be seen.</p>

<p>But it was not only enclosures to which the attention of the
officials was directed. The postal charges were found so oppressive
that several merchants who had letters to send to the same
town used to write their several communications on the same
sheet, which on reaching the person addressed was by him passed
on to the others, whose letters were on the same sheet.</p>

<p>In the post office the practice was much condemned. As it
was not specifically provided against in the act, it had to be
tolerated until the act was amended; and thereafter when several
letters were written on one paper, each was to be charged as a
distinct letter. The letter inspectors then had to satisfy themselves
that there was no more than one person's handwriting in
the sheet, which was, of course, carefully sealed with wax.</p>

<p>The ounce letter needs no explanation. At present the ounce
is the unit of weight for letters sent from Canada to every part
of the civilized world. In this aspect it corresponds with the single
letter of the pre-penny postage days. But the ounce letter of
1710 and of over a century afterwards was far removed from the
single letter in the matter of postage.</p>

<p>In that respect the ounce letter was equal to four single letters,
and was charged four times the rate of the single letter. Thus,
while a single sheet weighing less than an ounce could pass between
two neighbouring towns not over sixty miles apart for fourpence,
if it tipped the ounce weight it was chargeable with sixteen pence.</p>

<p>The act of 1710 offered a problem to the paper makers. A
sheet of paper had to be made stout enough to stand the handling
of the post office without the protection of an envelope, and be
yet so light as to allow the largest space possible within the ounce
weight.</p>

<p>Under this system, in which distance, number of enclosures
and weight were all factors, the charges for letters, such as are
posted by thousands in our larger offices every day, were very
high. An ounce letter, which at the present time costs but two
cents to convey to the remotest post office in the North West of
Canada, or to Southern Mexico, in 1710 cost three shillings to
carry from New York to Philadelphia. From New York to
Boston, the postage on the same letter was four shillings. Between
the outermost points of the North American postal system in 1710&mdash;Portsmouth,
N.H., and Charlestown, N.C.&mdash;the postage for an
ounce letter was ten shillings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The act of Queen Anne's reign, so long the charter of the British
postal system, also greatly increased the charges on letters passing
between the mother country and the colonies. In place of the
penny or twopence which satisfied the captains for the delivery
in America of the letters which had been placed in the letter bags
hung up in the London coffee houses, the postage on a single letter
passing from London to New York became one shilling. If the
letter weighed an ounce, the charge was four shillings.</p>

<p>Captains of vessels, moreover, were no longer at liberty to disregard
the requirements of the post office that they should deliver
their letters at the post office of the port of arrival. If they failed,
they laid themselves open to a ruinous fine.</p>

<p>Remembering the resentment with which half a century later
the Americans greeted every scheme, which could be construed
into imposing a tax without their consent, one wonders how the
post office act of 1710 was regarded in the colonies.</p>

<p>The question is interesting enough to warrant some inquiry.
The legislative records have been searched carefully, and also,
so far as they were available, the newspapers of the period. With
one exception about to be mentioned, the only reference to the
post office act which has been discovered is in the New Hampshire
records. There it is stated that the act was read before the council
on the 13th of September, 1711, and afterwards proclaimed by beat
of drum in the presence of the council and of some members of the
house of representatives.</p>

<p>The case in which the act came into question occurred in
Virginia. This colony had no post office in 1710, nor for a considerable
period afterwards; and it was the attempt to put the
post office in operation in 1717 which led to the protest and the
countervailing action.</p>

<p>Virginia seems to have had no desire to be included in the
American postal system. In 1699 Hamilton reported on the proposition
of extending the system southward to Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The
extension would cost £500; and Hamilton declared that the desire
for communicating with the northern colonies was so slight that
he did not believe there would be one hundred letters a year
exchanged between Virginia and Maryland and the other colonies.
Practically all the correspondence of the two colonies was with
Great Britain and other countries in Europe.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1717, steps were taken to establish a post
office in the two colonies, and to connect them with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
colonies. Postmasters were appointed in each colony. Couriers
carried the mails into several of the more populous counties; and
a fortnightly service was established between Williamsburg and
Philadelphia. This was quite satisfactory, until the people began
to read the placards which they observed affixed to every post
office wall, directing that all letters, not expressly excepted by
the act of parliament, should be delivered to the local postmasters.
Here was matter for thought.</p>

<p>A glance at the tariff showed that the charge made by the post
office on a letter from England was one shilling for a single letter.
The letters from England were the only letters the people of
Virginia cared anything about, and they were accustomed to pay
only a penny as postage for them.</p>

<p>There was some little trouble, and perhaps a slight risk attending
the safe delivery of letters by the existing arrangement.
Virginians were, however, used to it, and had no great fault to
find. It might be that if they could have received their letters
at the post office for the same charge as they paid for receiving
them direct from the ship captains, they would have preferred
going to the post office.</p>

<p>But the difference in convenience between the two places of
receipt was not worth the difference between one penny and
one shilling; and indeed it looked uncommonly as if the government
were using this means to tax them elevenpence on every
letter they received.</p>

<p>The people, on realizing the condition of things, made a great
clamour.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Parliament, they declared, could levy no tax on them
but with the consent of the assembly; and besides that, their letters
were all exempted from the monopoly of the postmaster general
because they nearly all, in some way or other, related to trade.</p>

<p>The Virginians were putting an unwarrantably broad interpretation
on an exemption, which appears in all post office acts,
in favour of letters relating to goods which the letters accompany
on the vessel. It has always been the practice to allow shipmasters,
carrying a consignment of goods, to deliver the invoice to the
consignee with the goods, in order that the transaction might be
completed with convenience.</p>

<p>It would not be practicable, however, to confine this exemption
to invoices accompanying goods, as this would require a
knowledge of the contents of letters, which could not be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
without an intolerable inquisition. Consequently, it has been
customary to allow all letters accompanying consignments of
goods to be delivered with the goods, without asking whether they
relate to the goods or not. But the scope of the exemption is
clearly defined, and has never been allowed to include ordinary
business letters, not accompanied by goods.</p>

<p>The Virginians, however, were not content to leave their case
to the precarious chances of a legal or constitutional argument.
They set about neutralizing the post office act by an effective
counter measure. A bill was submitted to the legislature which,
while it acknowledged the authority of the post office act, imposed
on postmasters giving effect to it certain conditions which it was
impossible to fulfil, and attached extravagant penalties for the
infraction of those conditions. The postmasters were to be fined
£5 for every letter which they demanded from aboard a ship&mdash;letters
of a character which the British statute exempted from the
postmaster general's exclusive privilege.</p>

<p>Now every ship's letter bag would contain probably many
letters relating to goods aboard the ship, as well as many which
were in no way so related. But how was the postmaster to tell
the letters accompanying goods from those which did not? Even
if the ship's captain assisted to the best of his ability, which was
more than doubtful, there would be many letters about which
the postmaster could not be certain, and with a £5 penalty for
every mistake, his position was not an enviable one.</p>

<p>Another clause in the bill of the legislature of Virginia contained
a schedule of hours for every courier. The terms of the
schedule were so exacting that compliance with it was impossible.
The penalty attached to every failure to observe the hours set
forth, was twenty shillings for each letter delayed.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> As the governor
pointed out, the difficulties of travel during the winter season,
owing to the number of great rivers to be passed, would subject
the postmasters to the risk of a fine for every letter they accepted
for transmission at that period of the year.</p>

<p>The bill of 1718, when sent up for the governor's assent, was
promptly vetoed; but on the other hand, the intention of the
deputy postmaster general to establish a post office in Virginia
was not pressed. It was not until 1732, when the governor had
relinquished his office, and had himself been appointed deputy
postmaster general, that Virginia was included in the postal system
of North America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Even after that date the post office in Virginia was on a somewhat
irregular footing, at least in regard to the conveyance of the
mails. In a gazetteer published in 1749,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> it is stated that while
regular trips are made by mail courier from Portsmouth to Philadelphia,
southward to Williamsburg the courier's movements
were uncertain, as he did not set out until there were sufficient
letters posted for the south, to guarantee his wages from the
postage on them. There was a post office at this period as far
south as Charlestown, but the post carriage for that office was still
more uncertain.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Virginian contretemps, the period
from 1710 until after the middle of the eighteenth century was one
of quiescence. Deputy postmaster general succeeded deputy
postmaster general; and the annals of their administrations carry
little that is interesting. After the retirement of Hamilton in
1721, a change was made in the relations between the deputy
postmaster general and the general post office, by which the post
office in London was relieved of all expense in connection with
the maintenance of the North American postal system.</p>

<p>Hamilton had a salary of £200 a year. But the profits from the
post office did not quite cover that amount, as on his withdrawal,
there was due to him £355 arrears of salary. In recommending the
claim to the treasury, the postmaster general stated that the post
office in America had been put on such a footing that if it
produced no profit, it would no longer be a charge on the revenue.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The facilities given to the public were not increased during
that period. Indeed, in 1714, they were diminished, as the courier's
trips between Boston and Philadelphia, which in 1693 were performed
weekly throughout the year, were reduced to fortnightly
during the winter months, and they remained at that frequency
until 1753.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the post office was not used by the public
any more than was absolutely necessary, and that every means
was taken to evade the regulations designed to preserve the postmaster
general's monopoly. Thomas Hancock, in a letter written
in 1740, to Governor Talcott of Connecticut, told him that he
saved the colony from forty shillings to three pounds every year,
through the interest he had with the captains of the London ships,
who delivered the letters to him instead of handing them over to
the post office.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The line of undistinguished representatives of the British post
office in America came to an end in 1753, when Benjamin Franklin
was made deputy postmaster general, jointly with William Hunter
of Virginia.</p>

<p>Franklin, besides being a man of eminent practical ability,
brought to his task a large experience in post office affairs. He
had been postmaster of Philadelphia for fifteen years prior to his
appointment to the deputyship; and for some time before had
acted as post office controller, his duty being to visit and instruct
the postmasters throughout the country.</p>

<p>At the time Franklin and Hunter entered upon their office
they found little to encourage them. The couriers who conveyed
the mails were much slower than most other travellers on the
same roads. It took six weeks to make the trip from Philadelphia
to Boston and back, and during the three winter months, the
trips were made only once a fortnight.</p>

<p>The new deputies so reorganized the service that the trips were
made weekly throughout the year, and they shortened the time by
one-half; and many other improvements were made.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> For a time
the expenditure of the post office largely outran the revenue.
But the usual rewards of additional facilities to the public
followed.</p>

<p>In 1757, when the outlay had reached its highest point, and the
public response to the increased facilities was still but feeble, the
post office was over £900 in debt to the deputy postmasters general.
Three years later this debt was entirely cleared off, and the operations
showed a surplus of £278. In 1761 the surplus reached the
amount of £494, and this sum was transmitted to the general
post office in London.</p>

<p>The receipt of this first remittance was the occasion of much
satisfaction to the postmasters general. For a generation the
post office in America had been nearly forgotten. Since 1721, it
had cost the home office nothing for its maintenance, and for long
before that time it had yielded nothing to the treasury, and so it
had been allowed to plod along unregarded.</p>

<p>A remittance from this source was quite unexpected, and one
can imagine the pleasure with which the entry was made in the
treasury book, and the words added "this is the first remittance
ever made of its kind."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But though the first, it was by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the last; for until Franklin's dismissal in 1774, a remittance from
the American post office was an annual occurrence. Franklin
declared that, at the time of his dismissal, the American office
yielded a revenue three times that from Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The success of the post office under Franklin's regime suggests
the question, as to the share Franklin had in that success. During
the whole course of his administration, he had with him an associate
deputy postmaster general, William Hunter, from 1753 until
1761, and John Foxcroft, from 1761 until his connection with the
post office ceased.</p>

<p>Little is known of the capacity of either of these officials; of
Hunter, practically nothing. Foxcroft was certainly a man of
intelligence, but nothing is known to warrant the belief that he
possessed unusual qualities. That the routine of post office
management was left in the hands of the associates, may be
inferred not so much from the multifarious character of Franklin's
activities, for he seems to have been equal to any demands made
upon him, as from the fact that out of the twenty-one years of his
administration, fifteen years were spent in England as the representative
of the province of Pennsylvania in its negotiations with
the home government.</p>

<p>That Franklin's occupations in England did not absorb all
his time is amply proven by his voluminous correspondence which
shows him to have been engaged in abstruse speculations in science,
and in economic and philosophic studies. But to administer an
institution like the post office one must be on the spot, and the
Atlantic ocean lay between him and his work from May 1757,
until November 1762, and from November 1764, until his dismissal
in 1774. Franklin was in America while the measures were taken
which put the post office on an efficient footing, and again in 1763,
when the treaty of Paris confirmed England in her possession of
Canada.</p>

<p>Franklin's contribution to the North American post office
consisted mainly, it would seem, in certain important ideas, the
application of which turned a half century of failure into an
immediate success. It is a commonplace that money spent in
increased facilities to the public is sure of a speedy return with
interest, and in private enterprises competition keeps this principle
in fairly active employment.</p>

<p>This is not the case with an institution like the post office,
until, at least, each new application of the principle had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
justified by success. A post office is a monopoly, and at certain
stages of its history that fact has been its bane. To-day when the
demands of social and commercial intercourse make an efficient
vehicle for the transmission of correspondence a necessity, the evils
inherent in monopolies sink out of sight so far as the post office is
concerned.</p>

<p>A peremptory public takes the place of competitors as a motive
for alertness. The faults of the institution are freely exposed,
and correction insisted upon; and, what is as much to the point,
the public contributes of its ingenuity for the improvement of
the service. When, towards the end of the eighteenth century,
the British public was disgusted with the slowness of its mail carts,
and dismayed at the number of robberies, Palmer, a Bath theatre
manager, came forward with his scheme for the employment of
fast passenger coaches for the conveyance of the mails.</p>

<p>A half century later the public united in a demand for lower
postage rates; and Rowland Hill, a schoolmaster, produced a
scheme, which for originality and efficacy, has given him a high
place among the inventors of the world. To-day the Universal
Postal Union affords a medium by means of which the results
achieved by every postal administration are brought into a common
stock for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>But when Franklin took hold of the North American post
office, he had none of these aids to improvement. The measure
of the public interest in the post office may be taken from the fact
that its total revenue during the first three years of his administration,
from 1753 to 1756, was £938 16<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>&mdash;but little more
than £300 a year.</p>

<p>As for encouragement or stimulus from the outside, there was
none. The only connection the American post office had was
with the home office; and it is doubtful whether, even if it had
been disposed, the British post office could have lent any helpful
advice in those days.</p>

<p>The British post office was at that time passing through one
of its unprogressive periods. It had come to know by long years
of observation what was the volume of correspondence which
would be offered for exchange, and it provided the means of
transmission, taking care that these should not cost more than
the receipts.</p>

<p>Franklin's merit lay in his rising above an indolent reliance
on his monopoly, and in his generous outlay for additional facilities,
by means of which he not only drew to the post office a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
amount of business, which was falling into other hands, but called
into existence another class of correspondence altogether.</p>

<p>It is tolerably certain that had Franklin's work lay in England
instead of America, he would have anticipated Palmer's suggestion
that the stage coaches be used for the conveyance of the mails,
instead of the wretched mail carts which came to be regarded as
the natural prey of the highwayman.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1764 the post riders between New York
and Philadelphia made three trips a week each way; and at such
a rate of speed that a letter could be sent from one place to the
other and the answer received the day following.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In reporting
this achievement to the general post office, Franklin states that
the mails travel by night as well as by day, which had never been
done before in America.</p>

<p>Franklin planned to have trips of equal speed made between
New York and Boston in the spring of 1764, and the time for
letter and reply between the two places reduced from a fortnight
to four days. When his arrangements were completed a letter and
its reply might pass between Boston and Philadelphia in six days,
instead of three weeks.</p>

<p>As a result of these arrangements Franklin anticipated that
there would be a large increase in the number of letters passing
between Boston and Philadelphia and Great Britain by the packets
from New York. That the fruits of his outlay answered his
expectations is clear from the fact that the revenues, which up
to the year 1756 had scarcely exceeded £300 a year, mounted up to
£1100<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in 1757, and that became the normal revenue for some time
after.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the British government began
to employ packet boats for the conveyance of the mails to the
American colonies. Until this time there had been no regular
arrangements for the conveyance of the mails between Great
Britain and the colonies. There were no vessels under specific
engagement to leave either Great Britain or America at any
fixed time.</p>

<p>This is not, of course, to say that there were no means of
exchanging correspondence between England and America, or
even that the post office had no control over the vessels by which
letters were carried. Vessels were continually passing between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Falmouth or Bristol and New York or Boston in the course of
trade; and these were employed for the conveyance of mails.
Sometimes the letters were made up in sealed bags by the post
office before being handed to the shipmasters; and sometimes
they were handed loose to the captains, or picked up from the coffee
houses.</p>

<p>The captains were under heavy penalties to hand over to the
post office all letters in their possession, when they reached their
port of destination, and they were entitled to one penny for each
letter so delivered to the local postmasters. By this arrangement,
the cost of carrying the letters across the Atlantic fell in no degree
upon the post office. Indeed, after the act of 1710, the post office
made a very good bargain of the business. The postmasters paid
the shipmasters a penny a letter, and the act of 1710 authorized
them to collect a shilling for each letter delivered to the
public.</p>

<p>A service so irregular had its disadvantages, however. Captains
were of all degrees of trustworthiness. Some could be depended
upon to deliver the letters at the post office as the law directed;
others were careless or unfaithful. These either did not deposit
their letters with the postmasters promptly as they should have
done, or they had private understandings with friends by which
the letters did not go into the post office at all, but were delivered
by the captains directly to the persons to whom they were directed.</p>

<p>In 1755 the board of trade called attention to the great "delays,
miscarriages and other accidents which have always attended the
correspondence between this kingdom and His Majesty's colonies
in America, from the very precarious and uncertain method in
which it has been usually carried on by merchant ships." The
remedy sought was a line of sailing vessels devoted entirely to the
conveyance of correspondence. Services of this class were not
uncommon, although they were usually confined to a time of
war. During the war of Spanish Succession, packet ships ran
regularly to Holland and to France.</p>

<p>It was during this war when French and Spanish privateers
held the southern seas, that the first line of mail packets was
established, which ran to North America. In 1705, the British
government contracted for five vessels of one hundred and forty
tons each, to carry the mails to and from the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Each
vessel was to carry twenty-six men and ten guns. The contractor
was paid £12,500 a year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>A curious feature of the contract was that the contractor was
required to enter into a warranty that the receipts from the vessels
for mails and passengers would not be less than £8000. If they
did not come up to this amount, the contractor had to make up
the shortage, up to the sum of £4500 a year. The contract was
for three years certain, with an additional two years if the war
should last so long.</p>

<p>The postal business of the West Indies was comparatively
large at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The receipts
for the two years ending January 1706&mdash;£10,112<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;make the
American continental business, even under Franklin's capable
management, very small by comparison. In 1760 the receipts
from the colonial post office of North America were only £1100.
This packet service to the West Indies was maintained until the
peace of Utrecht in 1713.</p>

<p>During the same period, repeated efforts were made by English
merchants, to have a packet service to the North American colonies.
In 1704 a petition was presented to the government for a mail
service between England and New York.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The petitioners asked
that the vessels be employed for letters only, in order that by their
greater speed they might outrun the merchant vessels on their
homeward trips and by giving timely notice, make it possible to
send out cruisers to meet the merchant vessels and escort them
home in safety. They observed that, in the year before, eighteen
of the Virginia fleet were captured because they had set out later
than was expected.</p>

<p>The treasury were unimpressionable. They read the memorial,
and after adding to it the curt query "Whether the merchants
intend to be at the charge," they dismissed it from further consideration.
In 1707, the question was again brought to the attention
of the treasury, and they asked Blathwayt, a commissioner
of trade, to give them a report upon it.</p>

<p>Blathwayt was hearty in support of the proposition.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He
declared that "Her Majesty's plantations in America are at present
the chief support of the kingdom without impairing their own
proper strength and yet capable of very great improvements by
their trade and other means." He pressed for the establishment
of a service with trips six or eight times a year. In view of the
war, however, Blathwayt considered it inadvisable to fix upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
certain rendezvous on either side of the Atlantic, as this would
enhance the opportunities for interception by the enemy.</p>

<p>The treasury were willing to have one or two experimental
trips made to ascertain what revenue might be expected from
the service, if these could be secured without expense; and they
accepted a proposition, made about this time, by Sir Jeffry Jeffrys,
who was preparing to make two trips to New York.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Jeffrys
asked that his vessel might be commissioned as a packet boat,
and that he might be allowed to retain the postage on all the
correspondence which he carried between England and America.
There is no record of the result, but from what is known of the
postal business in America, it cannot be supposed that it would
be of a magnitude to encourage the establishment of a packet
service.</p>

<p>Other offers were made to the government, but they were not
seriously considered until the outbreak of the war in America
between England and France in 1744. Orders were at once given
for the restoration of the packet service to the West Indies; and
in 1745 armed packets again carried the mails on this route.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The service was very expensive; for though the revenue reached
the respectable figure of £3921 in the first year, this amount was
far from covering the outlay; and as soon as the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
was signed in 1749, the packets were discontinued.</p>

<p>The peace, which followed the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, was
of short duration. So far as America was concerned, the treaty
did little more than to impose upon the combatants a momentary
suspension of arms. It did nothing to remove the causes of war,
and while these remained a permanent peace was impossible.</p>

<p>The grounds of dispute were almost entirely territorial. The
French claimed the whole vast stretch of country to the west of
the Alleghanies, and set up a line of forts along the valley of the
Alleghany and Ohio rivers. The English disregarded these claims,
and their traders pushed over the mountains into the disputed
territory. The French displayed so much energy in dispossessing
the encroaching English, that the border country was kept in a
state of alarm, and the governors of the English colonies appealed
to have a regular means of communication established between
the mother country and the colonies, so that help might be obtained
if required.</p>

<p>The representations of governors Shirley of Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Delancey of New York, and Dinwiddie of Virginia, were vigorously
supported by governor Lawrence of Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The situation of Nova Scotia was one of peculiar danger.
The province was hemmed in between Cape Breton, with its powerful
fortress at Louisburg, on the one side, and Canada on the
other. The control which the French exercised over the valley
of the St. John, and over the isthmus of Baie Verte, gave them a
safe and easy passage from Canada to Cape Breton, by way of the
St. John river, the bay of Fundy, the isthmus of Baie Verte, and
the straits of Northumberland. The Acadians who were scattered
over Nova Scotia were naturally in hearty sympathy with their
own people in Cape Breton; and in order to send supplies of cattle
to the fortress, they made a small settlement at Tatamagouche,
on the straits of Northumberland, which served as an entrepôt.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The first result of the appeal of the governors was the establishment
of a post office at Halifax, in the spring of 1755,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and
the opening up of communication with New England by the vessels
which plied to and from Boston. It required a ruder prompting
before the government could be induced to spend the money necessary
for a packet service, and this was not long in coming.</p>

<p>In the early spring of 1755, General Braddock, with two regiments,
was sent to America to oppose the large claims made by
the French. In concert with the governors of Massachusetts
and Virginia, a plan of attack was arranged which involved movements
against four different points as widely separated as fort
Duquesne on the Ohio river, and Beausejour on the bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>Braddock undertook the expedition against fort Duquesne,
which if successful would break down the barrier which was confining
the English colonies to the Atlantic seaboard, and relieve
the more westerly settlements of Virginia and Pennsylvania from
the harassing attacks which were making life on the frontiers
unendurable. The execution of his part of the campaign was beset
by difficulties, arising partly from the mountainous and woody
character of the country through which he had to pass, and partly
from his ignorance of the methods of forest warfare, in which his
enemies excelled.</p>

<p>Whatever could be accomplished by dogged energy was done
successfully. Braddock managed to get his army within sight of
his destination. But here his good fortune left him. While still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in the thick woods he was attacked by the French and their Indian
allies. Employing methods to which Braddock was a stranger,
methods which would have seemed to him to be unworthy of
soldiers, the French and their allies managed to keep themselves
in perfect cover, while the British army stood exposed, the easiest
of marks.</p>

<p>There could be but one outcome. The British were overwhelmed
and Braddock slain; and the only result of the campaign
was to redouble the fury of the enemy against the unfortunate
border settlements.</p>

<p>The disaster and its consequences were brought home to the
government with a directness that put an end to all hesitation
about establishing the closest possible communication between the
mother country and the colonies. On the 18th of September, the
board of trade, which administered the affairs of the colonies,
approached the treasury on the subject. After emphasizing the
inconveniences of the existing arrangements, the board insisted
that it was of the highest importance that the king should have
"early and frequent intelligence of what is in agitation" in the
colonies, and recommended that packet boats be established to
New York.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The treasury approved, and directed the postmasters general
to arrange for regular monthly trips to New York, and to restore
the West Indian service, which was discontinued in 1749. Four
vessels of 150 tons each were provided for the latter route.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> They
were to carry twenty-six men each, and be fully armed for war.</p>

<p>For the New York route, larger vessels were thought necessary,
owing to the roughness of the winter seas; the vessels placed
on this line were each of 200 tons, and carried thirty men. The
carrying of any merchandise was forbidden, so that the vessels
were devoted entirely to the service of the post office.</p>

<p>In the elaborate instructions which the commanders received,
they were directed, when they had a mail for a place at which a
postmaster had not been appointed, to open the bags themselves,
and deliver the letters for that place to a magistrate or other careful
man, who would undertake to have the letters handed to the
persons to whom they were addressed. In case the vessel was
attacked, and could not avoid being taken, the commander must,
before striking, throw the mails overboard, with such a weight
attached as would immediately sink them, and so prevent them
from falling into the enemy's hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The new service was a most expensive one, and when peace
was concluded in 1762, the question of continuing it came up for
immediate consideration. During the seven years of its course,
the New York service cost £62,603; while the produce in postage
was only £12,458. The service was popular, however; and the
revenue had been increasing latterly, and an effort was made to
reduce the cost.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In this the postmasters general were successful,
and as the treasury saw reasons for indulging the hope that before
long the service would be self-sustaining, they sanctioned the
amended terms.</p>

<p>So far as the district in the neighbourhood of New York was
concerned, the service was very satisfactory. But the people in
the more remote southern colonies had ground for complaint in
the length of time it took for their letters to reach them after
arriving at New York.</p>

<p>No time was lost in despatching the couriers to the south;
but, at the best, between bad roads and no roads at all, there were
great delays in delivering the mails to Charlestown. In the fall of
1763, a proposition was made to extend the West Indies service
to the mainland, and to require the mail packet to visit Pensacola,
fort St. Augustine and Charlestown, before returning to Falmouth.</p>

<p>The extended scheme, which was accepted in 1764, involved
an entire reorganization of the postal service of the southern
colonies. The colonies to the south of Virginia were separated
from the colonies to the north and, with the Bahama Islands, were
erected into a distinct postal division, with headquarters at
Charlestown.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>A sufficient number of vessels were added to make a regular
monthly service,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> but in spite of this, the arrangements did not
give satisfaction. The route was too long to make it possible
to deliver the mails at Charlestown within a reasonable time.
The postmasters general reported that letters for those parts often
lay forty or fifty days in London before starting on their
way.</p>

<p>It was then resolved to break up the connection between the
mainland and the West Indies, and have a separate monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
service between Falmouth and Charlestown. To secure the greatest
measure of advantage from this service a courier was sent off with
the mails for Savannah and St. Augustine as soon as they arrived
at Charlestown from England.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>There were thus, from 1764, three lines of sailing packets running
between England and the North American colonies&mdash;one to
New York, another to Charlestown, and a third to the West Indies.
There was but one defect in these arrangements. They did not
provide connections between the several systems except through
the mother country.</p>

<p>A letter sent from New York to Charlestown or to the West
Indies had to travel across to London and back again by the first
outward packet to its destination. To connect the two systems
on the mainland, a courier travelled from Charlestown northward
to Suffolk, Virginia, where he met with the courier from New York.</p>

<p>In dealing with the means for establishing communication
between the mainland and the West Indies, the treasury were
called upon to consider a petition from the merchants who traded
to Florida. The termination of the war was followed by the withdrawal
of the troops which were stationed at Pensacola, the
principal trading settlement in Florida, and the merchants feared
the savages would plunder their goods, if succour could not be
easily obtained from the sister provinces.</p>

<p>The first step taken to meet the difficulty was to run a small
forty-five ton vessel from Jamaica to Pensacola and on to Charlestown.
This was satisfactory as far as it went, but as it took eighty-three
days to cover this route and return to Jamaica, this service
had to be doubled before the people concerned were content.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Communications in Canada prior to the Conquest&mdash;Extension of colonial
postal service to Canada&mdash;Effects of colonial discontents on post office.</p></div>


<p>Having described the several arrangements, which were made to
enable the older British colonists to correspond with the mother
country and with one another, we shall now turn to Canada.</p>

<p>In the first place an account must be given of the route pursued
by the courier, who was shortly to begin regular trips between
New York and Montreal. The route is the oldest in North America
and the best known. Before either Frenchman or Englishman
came to America, the Indian tribes, dwelling on the stretch of
land which lies between the waters running south and those running
north, passed and repassed over this natural highway in the prosecution
of their perpetual wars; and in the long struggle between
France and England for mastery of the continent, many of the
most decisive battles were fought at different places on the route.</p>

<p>The forts erected by each nation at the several strategic points
on the route within its territory indicate their conviction that this
was the ordinary course of passage from one country to the other.</p>

<p>A glance at the map confirms this view. From New York
to the boundaries of Canada, the few miles of watershed between
the Hudson and the lake Champlain systems are the only part
of this long route, which could not be easily travelled by vessel.
The first long stretch on the journey from New York to Montreal
was that between New York and Albany. This part of the trip
was made in one of the sloops, which were employed by the merchants
of Albany to carry furs, lumber and grain to New York,
and which usually returned to Albany empty or with a cargo of
brandy, which was considered necessary in their dealings with
the Indians. The trip up the river occupied about three days.</p>

<p>From Albany northward, there was a good road on the west
side of the Hudson as far as fort Edward, which stood at the bend
of the river, where it made a sharp turn to the west. At fort
Edward there was a choice of routes, one leading directly north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to lake George, and the other to the north-east to Wood Creek,
from which there was a navigable course into lake Champlain.</p>

<p>The lake George route also led into lake Champlain, though
the difficulties of the passage from one lake to the other subjected
the traveller to the inconvenience of a portage. Lake Champlain
offered an uninterrupted course to St. John's in Canada, from
which point there was a pleasant trip by carriage to Laprairie,
followed by a sail across the St. Lawrence to Montreal. The time
taken by travellers over this route was from nine to ten days.</p>

<p>The population of Canada at the period when it became a
British province was about seventy thousand, all of whom dwelt
on the shores of the St. Lawrence and its tributaries. Travellers
between Montreal and Quebec taking the river passage were wont
to declare that they seemed to be passing through one long village,
so closely were the settlements on each side of the river drawn to
one another.</p>

<p>Below Quebec, the country on the north shore in the <i>seigneuries</i>
of Beauport and Beaupré, as far east as Cap Tourmente, was as
thickly populated as any part of Canada. Beyond that point
settlement rather straggled on to Murray Bay. On the south
shore from Levis eastward, the census of 1765 showed a population
of over ten thousand. A gentleman travelling from Rivière du Loup
to Quebec a few years later stated that there were from
twelve to sixteen families to every mile of road.</p>

<p>Although people travelling in Canada preferred making their
journey by boat, there was a good road from Montreal to Quebec
and, what was unique in America at the time, there was a regular
line of post houses over the whole road, where <i>calèches</i> or carrioles
were always kept in readiness for travellers.</p>

<p>Each <i>maître de poste</i> had the exclusive privilege of carrying
passengers from his post house to the next, which was usually
about nine miles distant, his obligation being to have the horse
and carriage ready on fifteen minutes' notice during the day, and
in half an hour, if he were called during the night.</p>

<p>This facility for travel, the advantages of which are obvious,
was a gift from France, where it had been in operation since the
fifteenth century. When the road between Montreal and Quebec
was completed in 1734,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the post road system was at once established
upon it. It was a convenience which cost the government
nothing, the habitant who was appointed <i>maître de poste</i> receiving
his pay from the persons whom he conveyed within his limits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
The government confined its attention to seeing that the <i>maître
de poste</i> furnished the horses and vehicles promptly.</p>

<p>In September 1760, when the English became masters of Canada
by the capitulation of Montreal, Sir Jeffery Amherst, commander-in-chief
of the British forces, issued new commissions to the <i>maîtres
de poste</i>, and fixed the rate at which they should be paid for their
services, but gave directions that they should let their horses to
no person, who was not provided with a written order from the
governor.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>A question of much interest is suggested by the fact that the
post road between Montreal and Quebec had its origin during the
French regime. In France the post roads were part of the postal
system of the country, and the question occurs, by what means
were letters conveyed within Canada during the period of French
rule? It is probable that there was a considerable correspondence
between Canada and France, and the lines on which the business
of the country was conducted would seem to call for a fairly large
interchange of letters within the colony itself. Though the great
mass of the people were unable either to read or to write, they
differed but little in this respect from the same class of people
in other countries. It was not the custom of the time to look to
the working classes for patronage for the post office, though even
here it is to be observed that the girls of Canada had many opportunities
for securing the elements of education, which did not fall
in the way of the young men, and with the instinct for graceful
expression, which is nature's endowment to French women, it is
probable that many letters came from this class. From the towns,
however, there would be a relatively large correspondence. Although
the populations of Quebec and Montreal were less than
that of many of our country towns, and Three Rivers would not
bear comparison in that respect with many villages, the social
life in these towns was on a high plane. From Charlevoix to Montcalm,
every visitor to Canada expressed his astonishment at the
refinement and even elegance which he found in the towns. This
society, with its <i>seigneurs</i>, military officers, clergy and civil service,
would beyond doubt have an extensive correspondence with friends
at home. Indeed, mention of the clergy brings up that remarkable
series of letters written by Jesuit missionaries from the wilds of
Canada, known as the Jesuit Relations, which forms so large a part
of the foundation on which the history of the country in the seventeenth
century rests. The commercial correspondence was, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
considerable. All the trade between Canada and France was
carried on through the merchants of Quebec. Montreal from its
situation at the junction of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers
had been the chief town for the Indian trade in furs for over a
century, but it did not send its furs directly to France. The Quebec
merchants had been the intermediaries for this trade, and they
held jealously to the profitable privilege. The imports from France
which included a large part of the necessities and conveniences
of life, were also handled by the Quebec merchants, who acted as
wholesalers to the merchants in Montreal and the other parts of
the colony.</p>

<p>It will be obvious from a view of all these circumstances that
there must have been a large volume of correspondence to and from
as well as within Canada during the French regime. The greater
part of it would be between Quebec and the ports of France and
the means by which this was carried on, are known. In the <i>Royal
Almanach</i> for 1723, it is announced that on letters to Canada there
would be a charge of seven sols (about seven cents) which would
pay for the conveyance from Paris to Rochelle, while between
Rochelle and Canada, letters were carried free of all charge. Between
Old and New France, therefore, there was little restriction on
correspondence. If a letter going to France were destined for
Paris, it would be carried there for seven cents; if for other parts
of France, local and personal arrangements would have to be made
for their delivery. The case was the same with letters coming
to Canada, but addressed to other places than Quebec. Persons
living in Montreal, Three Rivers or any other place, who had
correspondence with France would arrange with friends in Quebec
to take their letters from the captain of the incoming ship, and
send the letters to them by the first opportunity. Kalm, the
Swedish naturalist, who was travelling through Canada as the guest
of the governor, states that, on the way up to Montreal on the
governor's <i>bateau</i>, they put in at Three Rivers in order that the
officer in charge might deliver some letters, which had been entrusted
to him.</p>

<p>The question of establishing such a postal system as existed
in France was laid before the governor as early as 1721. In that
year Nicholas Lanoullier, a clerk in the treasury, made application
for the exclusive privilege of carrying on a postal system between
Montreal and Quebec. He pointed out that the only means for
the conveyance of letters between Quebec, Three Rivers and
Montreal was the canoe, and as there was no regular canoe service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
a person desiring to send a letter had either to hire a canoe, or
wait until some person would be found willing to take the letter
in the course of his journey. Either mode was obviously unsatisfactory.
Lanoullier proposed to open post offices at the three
towns, for letters and couriers, and to maintain <i>messageries</i> or an
express service, and a line of post houses. There was no road
between Montreal and Quebec at this time, and as Lanoullier's
scheme involved the construction of a road, the governor granted
the application, and in addition gave Lanoullier the exclusive
privilege of establishing ferries over the rivers, which would cross
the road he undertook to build. As the total population of Canada
in 1721 did not exceed 25,000, and the towns of Quebec, Three
Rivers and Montreal contained no more than 2300, 325 and 3200
people respectively, an enterprise of that magnitude could not
possibly be profitable. Lanoullier no doubt realized this, for he
did nothing in pursuance of the scheme. It was ten years after
this period before any serious effort was made to construct a continuous
road from Quebec to Montreal, and by that time Nicholas
Lanoullier's connection with the work had ceased entirely. By
a somewhat curious coincidence, when the governor and intendant
resolved that the road should be constructed, the duty of superintending
the work fell upon a brother of Lanoullier, who was
appointed grand voyer or general overseer of the roads of the
colony. The office of grand voyer had existed in the colony since
1657, but until Lanoullier's time, it seems to have been neglected,
and when the habitants along the road were called upon to work
upon it, they obeyed with much reluctance. Lanoullier's difficulties
were increased by the hostility of the <i>seigneurs</i> through
whose estates the road was to pass, and who resented his making
his surveys without deference to their wishes and opinions. He
pushed forward the work with much energy, however, and by
1734 the road was opened. The intendant, Hocquart, who had
followed the road building with much interest, reported to the king
that he himself had made the journey in a carriage from Quebec
to Montreal in four days. As soon as the road was declared fit
for travel post houses were placed upon it at intervals of about
nine miles, and ferries were established for transportation across
the broader rivers which crossed the road.</p>

<p>But although no regular postal system was in operation during
the French regime, an arrangement existed from an early period,
by which the letters of the governor and intendant were carried
by an appointed messenger, who was permitted to take with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in addition to the official letters, any that might be entrusted to
him by private persons. The fee allowed the messenger by the
intendant's commission was ten sous for a letter carried from
Quebec to Montreal and five sous to Three Rivers, with proportionate
charges for greater or shorter distances. The commission
which was issued in 1705 by Raudot, the intendant, to Pierre
Dasilva dit Portugais, made no provision for regular conveyance,
but as the messenger conveyed all the governor's despatches within
the colony, it is probable that he made his trips with fair frequency.
Another messenger, Jean Morau, received a commission in 1727,
though he had been performing the duties of the service for ten
years before that date.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>A curious fact is disclosed in a memorandum prepared during
the period between the capitulation of Canada in 1760 and the
treaty of Paris, which settled definitively the possession of the
country. The writer, who had hopes that the country would be
restored to France, was discussing several measures for improving
the administration, when the French returned to the government.
Among these was the establishment of a royal post office. In
submitting his suggestion he pointed out that the system of royal
messengers was expensive to the country, as the letters of private
persons were carried and delivered free of charge. By the establishment
of a post office, the charges of maintaining it would fall
on the persons whose letters were carried, and the treasury would
be relieved of the expense.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>As has been already stated, when Franklin learned that Canada
was to remain a British possession, he came to Quebec to arrange
for the establishment of a postal service between Quebec, Three
Rivers and Montreal, and for a regular exchange of mails between
those places and New York. At Quebec he met with Hugh Finlay,
a young Scotchman who had been in the country for three years
and who had been performing the very important duties of justice
of the peace. In 1765, Finlay was made a member of the governor's
council, and until his death, thirty-six years later, took a leading
part in the affairs of the colony. Franklin opened a post office
in Quebec with Finlay as postmaster and put under his charge
subordinate offices at Three Rivers and Montreal. A monthly
service by courier was established between Montreal and New York,
whose duty it was to have the Canadian mails in New York in
time to place those for Great Britain on board the outgoing packet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
In making his arrangements for the exchange of mails between
the Canadian offices themselves, Finlay sought and obtained the
co-operation of the governor, who directed the <i>maîtres de poste</i> to
provide saddle horses for the mail couriers at sixpence a league,
which was just half the charge made to the public for the same
service, and who issued orders to the ferrymen along the route
to pass the couriers over their rivers promptly and without charge.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The captains of boats running on the river were instructed in their
duty to deliver the letters in their hands to the nearest postmasters
who would pay them one cent for each letter. The courier's
trips between Montreal and Quebec were made weekly each way,
and each trip took about thirty hours. As the distance is one
hundred and eighty miles, the advantages of the post house system
in facilitating the movements of the couriers are manifest.</p>

<p>A difficulty for which provision had to be made was the extreme
magnitude of the postage charges. In 1763 the American post
office was still working under the act of 1710, which was enacted
at a time when Canada as an English colony was not in contemplation.</p>

<p>The system for which provision was made by the act extended
from Piscataway (now Portsmouth, New Hampshire) to Charlestown;
and if letters were sent beyond the range of this system,
the charge for single letters conveyed up to sixty miles was fourpence;
and when the conveyance was from sixty to one hundred
miles the charge was sixpence. At the rate of sixpence for one
hundred miles, it cost two shillings to send a single letter from
New York to Montreal and three shillings from New York to Quebec.</p>

<p>This rate was quite prohibitive. Governors Murray of Quebec,
and Gage of Montreal, in 1760, represented to the home government<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
that the people of Canada were almost destitute of cash,
and that they would not write to their friends in England until
they found private occasions to send their letters to New York.
The governors suggested that every interest would be better served
if the rates could be made so that the charge on letters between
any two places in America might not exceed one shilling and sixpence
for a single letter.</p>

<p>In 1765, the act of 1710 was amended to meet the governor's
views.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The scale of fourpence for sixty miles and sixpence for
one hundred miles was not changed, but an addition was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to it by providing that for each one hundred miles or less beyond
the first hundred miles, the additional charge was to be twopence.</p>

<p>The reduction for the longer distances was very considerable.
Between New York and Montreal, the act of 1765 lowered the
charge for a single letter from two shillings to one shilling, and
between New York and Quebec from three shillings to one shilling
and fourpence.</p>

<p>Halifax, which had had a post office since 1755, had until this
time but little benefit from it owing to the excessive charges. But
the amendment of 1765 provided a rate of fourpence on single
letters passing between any two seaports in America, and thus
put Halifax in comparatively easy communication with Boston
and New York.</p>

<p>Here then in its entirety is the postal system of North America
as it was completed by the inclusion within it of the new province
of Canada. The most important communications were those
between America and Great Britain. Of these there were three:
with New York, Charlestown and the West Indies. Between
each of these places and Great Britain, packet boats carried the
mails once a month. These several divisions were united with
one another by a small packet from Jamaica to Charlestown,
and by a courier from Charlestown to Suffolk, Virginia, where
he met with a courier from New York.</p>

<p>Within the northern district, the centre of which was at New
York, there was a well-organized mail service, in which all existing
travelling facilities were employed to the limit of their usefulness.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Mails were transported regularly as far south as Virginia and as
far north and east as Quebec and Halifax. Within the better
settled parts of the country, the service was excellent. Before
the Revolution, two trips were made weekly between New York
and Boston, and three between New York and Philadelphia. From
Quebec to Montreal, there were two trips every week. The courier
service at this time was quite equal, if not superior, to the service
in England.</p>

<p>The financial affairs of the American post office flourished.
For the three years ending July 1764, there was a surplus revenue
of £2070.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The succeeding years, though satisfactory, were not
equal to those up to 1764.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>But the political troubles were rendering the post office an
object of unpopularity, and making it a duty on the part of the
patriots to employ agencies other than the post office for the transmission
of their letters. As these unofficial agencies were usually
satisfied with a much lower compensation than the post office
demanded, the pleasant circumstance arose for the patriot that the
line of interest coincided with the line of duty.</p>

<p>During the period between the establishment of the post office
in Canada in 1763, and the outbreak of the war of the Revolution
in 1775, the post office pursued on the whole an even, uneventful
course. Canada did not entirely escape the influence of the sentiments
which in the older colonies were leading to the Revolution;
and, as the war approached, the post office was made to feel the
effects.</p>

<p>There were, at the time of the peace of 1763, along with the
seventy thousand Canadians which made up nearly the whole
of the population, a number of the older British subjects, most
of whom had come from the British American colonies. At this
time they numbered about two hundred, and when the war broke
out in 1775, the number had doubled.</p>

<p>These new-comers to Canada were not without the usual
practical ability of Americans, and they very soon gathered into
their hands the greater part of the business of the colony. They
were, however, a source of much trouble and offence to the governor,
and to their Canadian fellow subjects. The governor reported
that their arrogance, and repugnance to the social and religious
customs of the new subjects&mdash;the former subjects of France&mdash;as
well as the factious opposition they displayed to the mode of
government then existing, retarded seriously the progress of the
efforts which were made towards conciliating the Canadians to
the new regime.</p>

<p>Nothing short of the complete domination of these few hundred
English-speaking people over the French Canadians would have
satisfied them. The spirit of rebellion grew no faster in the older
British colonies than among the few of English extraction in Canada,
and the mutual distrust between these people and the government
hampered the work of the post office a few years later.</p>

<p>In 1767 Finlay was called upon to remove a certain friction
which had arisen between the <i>maîtres de poste</i> and the travelling
public. The regulations, which confined travelling by post to
persons having special permits from the governor, were no longer
insisted upon. Any person desiring to do so was at liberty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
hire horses and carriages at any of the post houses for travel to
the next post house.</p>

<p>The easing of restrictions enlarged the business of the <i>maîtres
de poste</i>. But it evidently did not give unmixed satisfaction,
as complaints were made that many persons riding post imposed
upon the postmen, "threatening and abusing them contrary at
all law."</p>

<p>Finlay had no actual warrant for interfering on behalf of the
<i>maîtres de poste</i>, but as postmaster of the province, he had a strong
motive for picking up the reins of authority where he found them
lying in slack hands. He required the services of the <i>maîtres de
poste</i> to help him with the conveyance of the mails, and as those
services were rendered for half the charge which was made to the
travelling public, he kept the <i>maîtres de poste</i> under his influence
by constituting himself their champion. Finlay pointed to the
fact that in England the postmaster general was also general
master of the post houses, and declared that as deputy of the postmaster
general he would take the same position in Canada.</p>

<p>There was the essential difference between the situation in
England and in Canada that the postmaster general had statutory
authority for exercising control over the post houses in England,
whereas there was no such authority for control over the post
houses in Canada. However, Finlay was a member of the legislative
council, and he assumed, without opposition or question,
the charge of the <i>maîtres de poste</i>, and in 1767 issued public notice
that the post house system was to be under the same regulations
as were in force in England.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The <i>maîtres de poste</i> were confirmed
in their monopoly, and protected against imposition on the part
of the public.</p>

<p>Finlay's energetic management of the affairs of the Canadian
post office attracted the attention of his superiors, and as Franklin
had resided continuously in England since 1764 as agent for Pennsylvania
and other of the American colonies, the expanding scope
of the American post office demanded a greater degree of supervision
than Franklin's associate, Foxcroft, was able to give.</p>

<p>It was resolved to create another office, until then unknown in
America, called a surveyorship. The duties of the surveyor in
England are the same as those of the inspector in the Canadian
or United States services, and call for a general control over the
postal service within certain defined limits. The office of surveyor
was established in 1772, and Finlay was appointed to the position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
He was allowed to retain his charge of the post office in Canada,
though his salary here underwent an abatement.</p>

<p>The first duty assigned to Finlay as post office surveyor was
to explore the uninhabited country beyond the last settlements
on the river Chaudiere extending over the height of land into
New England.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The purpose of the trip was to ascertain the practicability
of a direct road between Quebec and New England. The
merchants of Quebec had made much complaint of the slowness
and irregularity of the ordinary communication with New York,
which was by way of Montreal, and they hoped that the proposed
road would materially shorten the journey to the principal places
in the northern colonies.</p>

<p>The road which the merchants of Quebec desired to see built
was a project which had occupied public attention at various
times for over a century before this time. When Louis XIV,
Colbert his minister, and Talon the intendant, were devising schemes
for the creation of a New France in North America, they observed
that the long Canadian winters, which shut up the port of Quebec,
made it desirable that there should be free access to an ocean port.</p>

<p>The treaty of Breda confirmed England in 1667 in its possession
of New York and New Jersey, and also established the right of
France to Acadia, which in the French view comprised not only
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but also that section of the state
of Maine which lies east of the Kennebec river. In 1671<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the king
directed Talon to see what could be done towards constructing
a road between the mouth of the Chaudiere and fort Pentegoet
at the mouth of the Penobscot, which was the headquarters of
the French governor in Acadia.</p>

<p>The purposes of the king were not unlike those of the fathers
of the present confederation. Canada was French and so was
Acadia, and the association of the inland with the maritime settlements
could not but be productive of good. The populations
were small: Canada had six thousand seven hundred, and Acadia
four hundred and forty-one,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but, for a short period, imperial
ideas prevailed.</p>

<p>Talon in 1671 despatched two explorers to Pentegoet. They
took different routes, although following the watercourses, and
their reports confirmed Talon as to the desirability of establishing
permanent communication between the two provinces. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
plans embraced a line of settlements on the Penobscot and Kennebec
rivers with a view to imposing a barrier to the advances of the
English. But Talon's health gave way, and he returned to France
in the fall of 1672, and as the king's ardour towards Canada was
cooling off, owing to his absorption in his European wars, the road
was abandoned.</p>

<p>The project was revived eleven years afterwards by de Meulles,
a later intendant. He was persuaded that if communication were
opened, the merchants of Quebec might secure the trade of the
Acadians which went entirely to New England, and the Acadians
would become attached to Canada. The road would have to be
settled upon, and de Meulles' plan was to place old soldiers upon it,
as he did not think the Canadians could be induced to give up
their comfortable lives, to enter upon a venture of that kind. De
Meulles' proposition, however, fell upon deaf ears, as did all others
calling for the outlay of money, and the scheme was allowed to
lie until Finlay took it up.</p>

<p>From the New England side a movement towards the height
of land separating Canada from the English colonies was made
in 1754.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Governor Shirley of Massachusetts in the early part
of that year, set out from Falmouth (now Portland) with eight
hundred men on an expedition up the Kennebec river. His purpose
was to dislodge any Frenchman who might be settled on the height
of land, and to establish a fort to secure the country against
attack.</p>

<p>Fort Halifax was erected at the junction of a stream called the
Sebastoocook with the Kennebec, and the Plymouth company
built a storehouse at the head of navigation on the Kennebec.
A carriage road was laid between the fort and the storehouse.
The governor anticipated that with fort Halifax as base he might
secure the mastery of the Chaudiere and even threaten Quebec.</p>

<p>As Talon in 1671, and Shirley in 1754, so Finlay in 1772 was
persuaded that a direct road from Quebec to New England was
altogether desirable, and that it might be made without unusual
difficulty. It was not, however, in the scheme of things that
Finlay should succeed any more than his predecessors. His preparations
were soon made. He explained his views to lieutenant
governor Cramahe, who headed a subscription to pay Finlay's
expenses, and inside of twenty-four hours he had ample means
at his disposal for his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Finlay set out in September 1773 with a party of Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and reached Falmouth after seventeen days of canoeing and following
trails. Having become satisfied as to the practicability of the
road, he addressed himself to the task of securing the co-operation
of those who might be supposed to benefit by the enterprise.</p>

<p>At Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he discussed the subject
with governor Wentworth. The governor was eager to help with
the scheme of establishing a further connection between Canada
and the colonies to the south, but was of opinion that the best
route would be over the tract of country between the Connecticut
river and the St. Francis river in Canada.</p>

<p>This route had several advantages. It avoided the watercourses
which made the road from Montreal to New York, and the proposed
Kennebec road, useless for so long a period every year; the passage
over the height of land was easy, and the country along the line
of the route between the height of land and the St. Francis was
favourable for settlement.</p>

<p>As Finlay was prepossessed with the governor's plans, the
governor set about putting them into execution. He laid a carriageable
road along the Connecticut to the boundary of his province,
and by April 1774 had a line of settlements along the road so that
the post rider would always have a stage at which to pass the night,
and generally have one within four hours' travel from any point
on the road.</p>

<p>Governor Wentworth lent to Finlay the services of his own
surveyor to explore the country on the Canadian side of the route,
but before anything could be accomplished in this way, the discontents
in the south had broken out in acts of rebellion, and the
post office was the first of the institutions of government to be
suspended.</p>

<p>At Boston, Finlay laid his plans before governor Hutchinson.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The interview was not encouraging. The governor declared that,
in the existing temper of the people, it would be enough for the
legislature to know that the governor favoured a scheme, to ensure
its defeat. The New Englanders had, besides this, but moderate
grounds for assisting in establishing further communication with
Canada.</p>

<p>The proposed road would be beneficial to Massachusetts in
so far as it aided colonization in the northern parts of the province,
but as the tract through which the proposed Kennebec road would
run lay largely in the grants of the Plymouth company, it would
be this company which would be the chief beneficiary of the enterprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and the legislature considered that the company should
bear the burden of the expense.</p>

<p>The company were not averse from assisting, but they indulged
the hope that with their interest in the legislature the government
might be induced to bear the cost. Another circumstance that
tended to cool the interest of the legislature was the belief that
in a short time this northern country was to be detached from
Massachusetts, and erected into a separate government. Altogether
Finlay concluded that unless the British government undertook
the scheme on the New England side, it would not be accomplished
at all.</p>

<p>Finlay's tour of exploration was ended by his arrival in Falmouth
at the beginning of October. He then entered upon the more
extensive duty of inspecting the whole postal service from Maine
to Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> He travelled southward from Falmouth, inspected
every post office, studied the conditions under which the mails
were carried, and made a full report of his investigations to the
postmaster general.</p>

<p>It is plain from his report that the service had deteriorated
seriously since Franklin and Foxcroft had made their last inspection
ten years before. Franklin, it will be remembered, had resided
in England since 1764, and Foxcroft undoubtedly found it impossible
to give proper attention to the post offices throughout
the country, and at the same time to keep abreast of the official
routine at the head office.</p>

<p>The postmasters on the whole impressed Finlay favourably.
They understood their duties and seemed to be making a commendable
struggle against the demoralization which confronted them
however they turned. Only a small proportion of the letters which
circulated within the colonies passed through the post office,
although their conveyance by any other means was illegal. The
consequence was that the revenues of the post office were small.</p>

<p>At Falmouth the greater part of the letters from Boston were
delivered by the masters of sailing vessels. The postmaster on
one occasion attempted to enforce the law against illegal conveyance
by seizing the letter bag on one of the incoming ships; but the
populace made so marked a manifestation of its displeasure that
he did not venture on that course a second time.</p>

<p>It was not so much, however, by direct defiance of the postal
law, although instances of this were not wanting, as by evasions
of it, that the monopoly of the post office was broken down. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
in many cases the evasions were so palpable that they could deceive
nobody. A popular mode of escape from the penalties attaching
to the breach of the monopoly was to seek shelter under one of the
exceptions which the post office act allowed.</p>

<p>In none of the acts, for instance, is objection made to a person
sending a letter to a correspondent by his own servant, or by a
friend who happened to be journeying to the place where the letter
should be delivered. Another exception to the monopoly was made
in favour of letters which accompanied merchandise to which
letters related. Thus a merchant in filling an order for goods
has always been at liberty to send with them the invoice, or any
other communication, having presumable reference to them. This
was the excepted article, which served the turn of those eluding
the monopoly.</p>

<p>What Finlay saw at New Haven illustrates fairly what was
going on throughout the colonies. Riders came in from other
towns, their carts laden with bundles, packages, boxes and canisters,
and every package had a letter attached. Some of the parcels
consisted of no more than little bundles of chips, straw, or old
paper, but they served their purpose. If the postmaster made
objection to the number of letters they carried, the riders asserted
their right to carry letters accompanying goods, and the public
saw to it that neither postmaster or magistrate took too narrow
a view of what constituted goods.</p>

<p>On the route between Boston and Newport the mail carrier
was a certain Peter Mumford, who did a much larger business
in the illegal conveyance of letters than as the servant of the post
office. At Newport the postmaster declared that there were two
post offices&mdash;the king's and Mumford's&mdash;and the latter did the
larger business. There was no remedy, as the postmaster declared
that whoever should attempt to check the illegal practice would be
denounced as the friend of slavery and oppression and the declared
enemy of America.</p>

<p>Many of the couriers did so large a carrying business that the
conveyance of the mails became a mere incident with them. As
he approached New Haven, Finlay was accosted with the inquiry
whether he had overtaken the post bringing in a drove of oxen,
which the courier had engaged to do, when he came in with the
mail.</p>

<p>In all respects but one, the situation described by Finlay presented
no unexpected features. There had been no general inspection
since Franklin made his tour in 1763, at the time he opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
post office in Quebec. This fact fully explains the shortcomings
of the postmasters and couriers. That the postmasters were
chargeable with so few irregularities in their accounts, or were
open to so little censure for faults in management, is high testimony
to their intelligence and fidelity to duty.</p>

<p>Mail couriers have always been less completely identified with
the postal service than postmasters. They are held by contract,
not by appointment, and their engagements are for short terms.
There is nothing irregular in their practice of combining the conveyance
of the mails with other means of gaining a livelihood,
but in the absence of supervision there was a constant tendency
to give undue attention to what should have been merely auxiliary
employments of carrying passengers and parcels.</p>

<p>People employing the couriers demanded prompt service, while
there was no person to insist on the prior claims of the post office,
and indeed there were probably few people in any community
at that time to whom an hour more or less was of any consequence
in the receipt of their letters.</p>

<p>The evasion of the postmaster general's monopoly also was too
common to excite particular remark. It was beyond doubt a
breach of the law, but that it was wrong was a proposition to
which few even good citizens gave assent, at least by their practice.
Thomas Hancock made a merit of his saving the colony of Connecticut
from thirty to forty shillings a year through the interest
he had with certain captains, which enabled him to secure the
colonial letters, as they came over in the ships, and thus prevent
their passing through the post office.</p>

<p>In England, also, the practice was wellnigh universal. The
increased rates imposed by the act of 1710 gave an immense impetus
to clandestine traffic. Every pedlar and driver of public
coaches lent himself to the profitable business of carrying
letters for a few halfpence a letter. In London an effort was
made to stop the practice by having officials of the post office
frequent the roads leading into the city, for the purpose of searching
the vehicles of those who had made themselves objects of
suspicion.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the work for which the post office
surveyors or inspectors were first appointed was to detain the mail
couriers in the course of travel, and check the contents of the mail
bags, and thus prevent postmasters from becoming parties, as
they too frequently were, to frauds on the revenue, to their own
great advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>As late as 1837, when Rowland Hill<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> laid his penny postage
scheme before a public which was impatient for its adoption,
Richard Cobden declared to a committee appointed to report on
the scheme, that five-sixths of the letters passing between Manchester
and London were conveyed by private hand. This state
of things continued until the postage rates were brought down
to a point, at which the service offered by the post office was cheaper
as well as better than any other. The only certain means by which
a government monopoly in a free country can maintain its position
is to outbid its rivals. There is no safe dependence to be placed
in legal process.</p>

<p>In ordinary times, then, the evasion of the exclusive privilege
of the postmaster general by any community would deserve no
more than passing mention. It is as part of a general boycott
of the government that the action of the Americans is worthy of
note.</p>

<p>From the time of the passage of the stamp act in 1765, the
attitude of the colonies towards all schemes in which taxation by
Parliament could be detected was one of resistance active or passive.
When this act went into operation, the Americans bound themselves
to import nothing from England, a self-imposed obligation which
in the undeveloped state of their manufactures entailed much
inconvenience and even distress.</p>

<p>There was an essential difference between the English and the
American methods of avoiding the penalties for infractions of the
post office law. In England, and to some extent doubtless in
America as well, men engaged in the illegal conveyance of letters
did their best to conceal their operations from the authorities.
The efforts of a public coach driver were directed to rendering the
search made by the post office inspectors fruitless. If letters were
found in his possession, he suffered the legal penalties as the smuggler
does to-day. It was one of the chances of his trade.</p>

<p>In the colonies men who were bent on circumventing the post
office pursued another course. They indulged their taste for legal
technicalities by carrying their letters openly, and maintaining
that the packages which accompanied them took them outside
the monopoly, and they gave scope to their humour by making
the packages as ridiculous as possible. They incurred no great
risk, for the active spirits in every community threatened a prosecutor
with a coat of tar and feathers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The stamp act was repealed in the year following its enactment,
and for the moment trade resumed its wonted course. But it
was not for long. The British government was determined that
the legislative supremacy of parliament should be recognized in
America, and the colonies were equally persistent in their denial
of this supremacy; and in the conflict which ensued the principle
weapons employed by the Americans until the outbreak of the
war were non-importation and non-exportation agreements.</p>

<p>As the British merchant exercised a preponderating influence
with the government, the stoppage of trade with America, as the
result of a constitutional dispute, was an effective instrument in
making the government consider the situation seriously. The
difficulty with the government was to understand the attitude
of mind which prevailed among the Americans.</p>

<p>The government had no quarrel with the principle that representation
should be a condition of taxation. It would have asserted
the principle on any occasion, but it could not see that the course
it was pursuing was a violation of that principle. Parliament,
it declared, was the great council of the nation, representing those
parts beyond the sea as well as those at home, and its measures
bound the whole nation.</p>

<p>It was still, it must be remembered, half a century before the
time when the agitations which preceded the great reform bill
of 1832 had familiarized the country with the distinction between
virtual and actual representation. The British parliament was
far from being, and indeed made no pretence of being a representative
assembly in the sense in which the phrase is now used. The
right to send members to parliament had for centuries been exercised
by the electors of counties and certain ancient boroughs,
and no enlargement of the representation was made from 1677
until 1832,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in spite of the great changes in population and industrial
importance which had taken place in the course of time.</p>

<p>Great manufacturing towns such as Manchester and Leeds
sent no members to represent them in parliament, while Old Sarum
which did not contain a single house elected two members. To a
people, who saw nothing in this state of things inconsistent with
the theory of representative government, the colonial view would
be quite incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The colonist on the other hand with his strict representation
in town meetings and colonial assemblies, and without the historical
aids to an understanding of the point of view of the home government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
saw little of a truly representative character in the British
system. But he did see, what the home government did not,
that a body of distinct and separate interests had grown up in
America of which parliament had a very inaccurate conception,
and with which it was in no way qualified to deal.</p>

<p>The attitude of the colonists did not appear to the government
to be quite free from insincerity. For half a century and more,
the government declared, the colonists had been subject to taxes
in the shape of post office charges imposed by the act of 1710, and
they had never raised a question.</p>

<p>In the Newcastle correspondence, there is a paper, dated 1765,
containing a discussion on the legality of a tax on the trade with
the Spanish West Indies. In the course of the paper it is asserted
that parliament, by the post office act of Queen Anne, imposed
an internal tax on the colonies without their presuming to dispute
the jurisdiction of parliament over them.</p>

<p>The disturbances in America which followed upon the attempts
to enforce the stamp act surprised and alarmed the government,
and a committee of parliament was appointed to consider what
their future course would be. Franklin who, as the representative
of several of the colonies, had been in London for a considerable
time, was among the witnesses examined by the committee. His
examination took a wide range, but the point of interest was the
question as to what ground in principle the Americans stood upon
in objecting to the stamp act, since they had accepted the post
office act of 1710.</p>

<p>For Franklin this was a crucial question, as he had been not
only administering the post office in America for twelve years
past, but he did not conceal his satisfaction that by his management
he had been able for several years to send substantial sums
to Great Britain as profits from the institution.</p>

<p>Franklin answered the questions with much ingenuity. The
money paid for the postage of a letter was not in the nature of a
tax; it was merely a <i>quantum meruit</i> for a service done; no person
was compellable to pay the money if he did not choose to receive
the service. A man might still, as before the act, send his letter
by a servant, a special messenger, or a friend, if he thought it safer
and cheaper.</p>

<p>The answer would have been quite just, if the postmaster
general of England had not held a monopoly of letter carrying
in America. While a person is free to use or not to use a certain
service, the charge for the service is not in the nature of a tax.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
If a person does not like the price demanded by the post office for
its services, he may seek other means of having his letters carried.
But the post office act does not leave a person free to employ other
agencies for the conveyance of his letters. The monopoly has
attached to it heavy penalties for its infringement.</p>

<p>It is true, as Franklin said, that the post office act leaves it
open to a man to employ a servant, special messenger, or friend
in the course of his travel, to carry his letters. But the mention
of these agencies shows the absurdity of Franklin's contention.
A merchant in New York having business to transact by letter
with a customer in Boston or Philadelphia could not afford to
pay the expenses of his messenger or servant unless the transaction
were one of considerable magnitude. Nor could he await the chance
of a friend's making a visit to either of these places. He might,
if he were free to do so, have entrusted his letters to a coach driver
who made a business of passing between New York and the other
two towns, but the monopoly of the post office stood in his way, and
the coachman would have made himself liable to a heavy fine.</p>

<p>In short, if the merchant had to correspond with neighbouring
places he was compelled to employ the post office. With a country
so extended and so highly civilized as the American colonies were
at that day, a postal system was an absolute necessity; and if
the system maintained by the government were protected by a
monopoly, its charges were a tax on the users of the system in so
far as those charges exceeded the strict cost of carrying on the
service.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the post office act of 1710 was imposed on
the colonies without their consent, and since Franklin's good
management had enabled him to pay all the expenses of the service
and send a considerable surplus to England for some years past, it
is plain that to the extent of the yearly surplus the colonies had
been subject to a tax laid on them without their consent, and
that Franklin himself was the tax gatherer. This was undoubtedly
where the point lay in the question which was asked of Franklin.</p>

<p>Franklin's views on the constitutionality of the post office
charges were part and parcel of his views on taxation generally.
For instance, he drew a clear line of distinction between a tax on
imported goods and an internal tax such as the stamp act. A
duty on imported goods it was permissible for parliament to impose
on the colonies, while an internal tax could not properly be levied
without consent.</p>

<p>The stamp act required that all commercial and legal documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and newspapers should be written or printed upon stamped paper
which was sold by agents of the government at varying prices
prescribed by the law. As this was a tax which could not be
avoided so long as men carried on their business in the ordinary
way and by the ordinary means, it was one for which the consent
of the colonies was necessary.</p>

<p>An import tax stood on a different footing. It was simply
one of the elements entering into the price of the goods imported.
If people objected to the price as enhanced by the tax, it was open
to them to decline to buy the goods. A tax of this sort was in
Franklin's view quite within the powers of the sovereign state.</p>

<p>The ultimate test applied by Franklin to determine whether a
tax could in a given case be constitutionally imposed, was whether
or not there was a legal mode of escape from the tax. If the tax
were an avoidable one, it was constitutional, since submission to
it implied consent. If, on the other hand, the tax were one which
from the necessities of the case could not be avoided, it ought not
to be imposed until it had been assented to by the people.</p>

<p>Opinions may differ as to which of the two classes the application
of the test would place postal charges in. They constituted a tax
beyond any question since they turned into the government a
surplus of revenue after all expenses had been met. Whether
they were to be regarded as an avoidable tax to be paid or not
as one cared to employ the services of a post office or not, or whether
as a tax which the circumstances of the community made it necessary
to accept, will depend on one's views as to whether a post
office is indispensable to the community.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how Franklin, who of all men of his generation
knew best the requirements of a highly developed industrial
community, could believe that the necessities for the interchange
of correspondence on the part of a people like the American colonists
could be satisfied by private messengers, or travelling friends,
or indeed by any agency less comprehensive than a national postal
system.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">The post office during the Revolution&mdash;Its suppression.</p></div>


<p>But the time was well past when the question as to what was
or what was not an allowable tax possessed any but an academic
interest. Though the stamp act was repealed a few months
after it went into operation, the trouble it aroused was not allayed.
The gratitude of the colonists which followed upon the repeal
gave way to renewed irritation when it was found that the ministry
in London had only postponed, not definitely abandoned, its
schemes of taxation, and the late triumph gave vigour to the
determination of the colonists to continue their resistance.</p>

<p>Step followed step. All went to widen the breach, and diminish
the chances of a peaceful settlement. The post office soon became
involved. As we have seen, the ministry endeavoured to
convict the colonists of, at least, inconsistency when they objected
to the stamp act, while tolerating the post office. Franklin
explained what seemed to him the points of difference between
the two things, without convincing the ministry.</p>

<p>The colonists had fully shared Franklin's opinions, but the
attitude of the ministry caused them to look more thoughtfully
into the matter. They finally agreed that the ministry might be
right in insisting that the post office charges were a tax, and
refused to use the institution any longer. Finlay found that
everywhere the view prevailed that the post office was unconstitutional,
and it was becoming hazardous to patronize it.</p>

<p>While Finlay was in the southern states the Boston tea riots
took place, and before he reached New York on his return home,
Franklin had been dismissed, and he had been appointed to
replace Franklin.</p>

<p>The reasons which led to Franklin's removal have been frequently
stated. They must be related again in order to complete
the narrative. Franklin had become possessed, by means still
unrevealed, of a number of private letters written by Hutchinson,
governor of Massachusetts, and Oliver, the lieutenant governor,
to a friend in England. The letters dealt with the condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
affairs in the colony, and discussed the situation with the full
freedom which a confidential correspondence is apt to encourage.</p>

<p>Hutchinson and Oliver dwelt upon the turbulent disposition
of Boston, expressed grave doubts as to the possibility of allowing
the full measure of English liberty in the colonies, and asserted
the necessity of a military force to support the government.
When these letters were brought to Franklin, he saw the advantage
that a knowledge of them would give the colonists in the struggle
then going on, and as the agent for Massachusetts, he asked for
permission to send the letters to the colony for perusal by a few
of the leading men. Permission was granted on Franklin's express
undertaking, that the letters should not be printed or copied.</p>

<p>In Boston, the letters were passed from hand to hand among
the popular leaders, and were finally discussed at a secret sitting
of the assembly. The assembly adopted resolutions strongly
condemnatory of Hutchinson and Oliver, as sowers of discord
between the mother country and the colonies, declared the letters
to be incitements to oppression on the part of the ministry, and
petitioned the king to remove Hutchinson and Oliver from their
government.</p>

<p>The publication of the letters gave rise to great astonishment
in England, and one of the consequences, before Franklin confessed
his part in the transaction, was a duel between a brother
of the person to whom the letters were written, and a gentleman
whom he accused of disclosing them to the public. In England
Franklin met with universal condemnation, and he was at once
dismissed from his position as deputy postmaster general in
America.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy as illustrating, partly Franklin's good nature,
and partly the apparent inability of the officials of the post office
to understand the state of mind of the ministry, that in spite of
his dismissal or of the reasons for it, Franklin remained on good
terms with the heads of the post office.</p>

<p>There was some delay in settling the accounts of Franklin
with the post office, but that was due to a lack of promptness on
the part of Foxcroft, Franklin's official associate, in rendering
the accounts. When the balance due by Franklin was paid, his
relations with the post office did not entirely cease; for he offered
himself, and was accepted, as one of the sureties for Foxcroft on
the re-appointment of the latter as joint deputy postmaster general
with Hugh Finlay.</p>

<p>For some time previous to the events which led to Franklin's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
removal from the service, plans were being considered for putting
the administration of the post office on a better footing. Although
New York was, by the terms of the act of 1710, made the official
headquarters of the service, it had not been so up till this time.
There seems to have been no fixed official residence. In 1749,
the deputy postmaster general resided in Virginia, and his predecessor
in North Carolina. Franklin and Foxcroft both happened
to live in Philadelphia, and that city accordingly became the
headquarters of the postal system.</p>

<p>It was determined in England that, after the 10th of October,
1773, New York should be the permanent administrative centre.
A central office was to be established, a general secretary appointed,
and suitable clerical assistance provided for the carrying on of
the work of administration. When Finlay was made joint deputy
postmaster general in Franklin's place, he continued to act as
travelling surveyor.</p>

<p>But the plans under contemplation did not come to maturity.
Already measures were on foot which in a short time deprived the
post office of its business in America. In March 1774, the colonists
began a movement to establish a postal system, which would be
independent of the regular post office.</p>

<p>The committee of correspondence in Boston, which was the
organ through which the opponents of government carried on their
work, wrote to the committee in Salem introducing William
Goddard, and suggesting the advisability of establishing a post
office in America.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The present post office, it was stated, was founded on an act
of the British parliament for raising a revenue from the colonies
without their consent, and for that reason was as obnoxious as
any other revenue act. The post office was being used as a precedent
against the colonies when they contested the right of
parliament to tax them, and furthermore, was now being employed
to prevent the dissemination of popular intelligence. Goddard,
for whom the Boston committee bespoke good will, would
explain to their associates in Salem by what means certain newspapers
identified with the people's cause were prevented from
circulating.</p>

<p>Goddard was not ill-fitted to take the lead in the agitation
against the post office. He was the son of the postmaster of New
London, and had been himself for two years postmaster of Providence,
and in this way was quite familiar with the details of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
in a post office. Moreover, during his residence in Providence,
and afterwards in Philadelphia and Baltimore, he was constantly
engaged in newspaper enterprises.</p>

<p>As Goddard's schemes were, for the most part, unsuccessful,
his wits never lost the edge that adversity usually gives. His
grievance was that the post office charged rates so excessive on
the newspapers he wished to circulate that he was unable to send
them to his readers throughout the colonies.</p>

<p>What measure of truth there was in Goddard's statements we
have no means of ascertaining. But there was no doubt that
the charge might be true, without the post office exceeding its
legal rights. The fact was that newspapers had no special legal
standing under the post office act.</p>

<p>That act was passed in 1710, when newsletters in manuscript
were in service and newspapers were too few and unimportant
to engage the attention of the post office or of parliament at the
time the law was being framed. Consequently no express provision
was made for them in the act. If newspapers were to be carried
by the post office under the authority of the act, it could only be
by treating them as letters, and a glance at the scale of charges
will show the impossibility of newspapers bearing so burdensome
a tax.</p>

<p>The newspapers of that day were inconsiderable in size compared
with those that are now published, but few even at that time
would weigh less than an ounce, and an ounce letter passing
between New York and Philadelphia called for a postal charge of
three shillings or seventy-two cents. This sum was the lowest
charge in the scale for ounce letters passing between any two
places of importance in America.</p>

<p>Clearly newspapers could not circulate by means of the post
office if they were to be regarded as letters. But as they were
not mentioned in the act, newspapers had at least the advantage
of not being subject to the postmaster general's monopoly. Publishers
were free to turn to account any means of conveyance that
happened to be available, for the distribution of their newspapers.
Unfortunately, however, this freedom was of little benefit at that
period, as there were no courier services regularly operating
between the towns in America.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but for publishers to take advantage
of the postal system if this were at all possible, and the possibility
appeared through one of those curious devices, which are the
derision of logical foreigners, but which afford a means of escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
from the inconveniences of a law, which it is not desired to alter
at the time.</p>

<p>In England, where the situation of newspaper publishers was
the same as it was in America, the privilege of franking newspapers
for transmission through the mails was conferred upon certain
officials of the post office, called clerks of the road. Clothed with
this privilege the clerks of the road bargained with publishers
for the conveyance of their newspapers in the ordinary mails,
and put the proceeds into their own pockets.</p>

<p>It was a practice that was not regarded as in any way irregular.
The post office was quite aware that its vehicles were being used
for the conveyance of newspapers, from which it received no
revenue, and it congratulated itself that it had hit upon a contrivance
for serving the public without having to tamper with
the act under which it operated.</p>

<p>The privilege of franking newspapers, which was enjoyed by
the clerks of the road in England, was also conferred upon the
deputy postmasters general in America, and colonial newspapers
were distributed by the post office under arrangements similar to
those described. While the act itself made no provision for the
conveyance and delivery of newspapers, this peculiar plan offered
great advantages to the publisher.</p>

<p>There was, however, one serious objection to it. Not resting
on the law, but on the good will of those in authority, it could
be terminated at any time, and the post office might legally charge
sums as high as the postage on letters for the conveyance of newspapers.
With this power in its hands the post office had complete
control over the fortunes of newspaper publishers. If for any
reason it desired to suppress a newspaper, all that was necessary
was to cancel the special arrangement between the deputy postmaster
general and the publisher, and leave to the latter the
option of paying letter rates or of finding some other means of
conveyance.</p>

<p>Whether this power was exercised in Goddard's case, is not
known; that it would be, if considered necessary, is beyond doubt.
In 1737, the clerks of the road in England were directed to take
particular care that no newspapers were sent by the post office
which contained reflections on the government,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and to assure
themselves on the point, they were to send no newspapers into the
country at all, except such as were purchased from a single dealer
named in the order, whose loyalty and judgment were not open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to question. The possession of this power by the government
was quite sufficient to arouse reasonable apprehensions.</p>

<p>Goddard appears to have succeeded in his mission to Salem,
as a few days later the committee of that town, responding to the
letter from Boston, declared that the act of the British parliament
establishing the post office in America, was dangerous in principle
and demanded peremptory opposition.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> A considerable sum was
raised for the fund to set up a colonial post office, although Salem
was in financial straits at the time.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in the first part of his campaign, Goddard
went a step forward, and drew up a plan for an independent
American post office, and laid it before the committees of correspondence
in all the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> His proposition was that the
colonial post office should be established and maintained by subscription,
and that its control should be vested in a committee to
be appointed annually by the subscribers. This committee would
appoint postmasters and post riders, and fix the rates of postage.
The immediate management of the service was to be under the
direction of a postmaster general to be selected by ballot, and who
should hold his office by a yearly tenure.</p>

<p>Goddard set about procuring subscribers for his scheme, and,
it would seem, with much success. In the meantime, however,
events were taking place which brought into being a body of
more authority than the committees of correspondence, and
this body took over the establishment of an American post
office.</p>

<p>The punitive measures of the ministry which followed upon
the Boston riots had the unexpected result of uniting all the
colonies into common cause with Boston. In September 1774,
the delegates of the colonies assembled in congress at Philadelphia,
and by degrees took upon themselves all the functions of government.
On the 29th of May, 1775, the question of providing for the
speedy and secure conveyance of intelligence was submitted to the
congress, and a committee, of which Benjamin Franklin was the
leading member, was directed to make a report.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>With the report before it, on July 26, the congress resolved<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
to appoint a postmaster general for the United Colonies, whose
office would be at Philadelphia, and who was empowered to appoint
a secretary and as many postmasters as seemed to him proper and
necessary. A line of posts should be established from Falmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to Savannah, with as many cross posts as the postmaster general
saw fit.</p>

<p>Goddard was a candidate for the position of postmaster general,
but Benjamin Franklin was chosen. Goddard's friends then made
an effort to secure to him the secretaryship. In this, also, he was
disappointed, as Franklin selected his son-in-law, Bache, for the
place, an appointment which brought down upon Franklin a
charge of nepotism.</p>

<p>It seems certain, however, that in no case would he have
entrusted the secretaryship to Goddard. Goddard had been
postmaster of Providence, and when he relinquished the office,
he was a defaulter for a considerable amount.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> As the loss from
Goddard's defalcation fell partly upon Franklin, as joint deputy
postmaster general, the latter would be reluctant to place him a
second time in a position of responsibility. Notwithstanding
the claims he would seem to have created for himself by his work
in organizing the colonial post office, Goddard had to be contented
with the surveyorship of the posts.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the service had been put in operation, the continental
congress discussed whether it would not be advisable
to suppress the king's post office.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Those in favour of the measure
argued that the ministerial posts were no longer necessary to the
people; that they merely subserved the interests of the enemy,
and that the postmasters held their offices by an illegal tenure.
On the other hand, it was urged that, closely watched as they
were, the ministerial posts could not lend themselves to harm,
and that they furnished the people with so many more means of
communication.</p>

<p>The argument which finally prevailed, however, was presented
by the opponents of the proposition. They pointed out that this
would be an extreme and irretrievable measure, an act of hostility,
which would not be warranted by the position in which they stood.
All that the colonies desired, they declared, was a return to the
conditions which prevailed in 1763, when the conquest of Canada
removed the last of the obstacles which impeded their progress,
and the relations of the colonies with the mother country seemed
permanently and satisfactorily established. Late advices from
England indicated that parliament was showing a renewed spirit
of conciliation, and any course was to be deprecated which would
prevent an easy return to the old conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The matter was laid over, but it was settling itself in another
way. Great Britain was recognizing the futility of persisting in
its efforts to maintain the post office in the colonies. As early as
March 1775, the home office advised its deputies in America that
all that was to be expected from the postmasters in the colonies
was that they should act with discretion to the best of their abilities
and judgment.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It ceased for the time to give positive directions.</p>

<p>Finlay, who, at some personal risk, had gone to New York to
make up his accounts, reported that the post office was doing but
little business, as the rebels were opening and rifling the mails,
and were notifying the loyally disposed that it was unconstitutional
to use the king's post office.</p>

<p>There was swift punishment visited upon erroneous constitutional
views at that time. Finlay foresaw that the post office
could not long continue, and he proposed that the work of distributing
the mails should be done on one of the war vessels in
New York harbour.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> At last, on Christmas day 1775, the secretary
of the post office at New York gave public notice that on account
of the interruptions to the couriers in several parts of the country
the inland service would cease from that date, and thus was closed
an important chapter in the history of the British post office in
North America.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>With the outbreak of the war, the postal connection between
New York and Montreal instantly ceased. When this event took
place the service to and from Canada was in a very efficient state.
Two couriers travelled each week between Montreal and New York,
one passing by way of lake George, and the other pursuing the
route through Skenesborough (now Whitehall); and post offices
were opened at Crown Point and Fort Edward.</p>

<p>It was far, however, from the wishes of the provincial congress
of New York to allow the communication with Canada to be
broken. This body, after a conference with Price, a gentleman
from Montreal, despatched a letter to the merchants of that
place, expressing their strong desire that the intercourse existing
between New York and Canada should be maintained.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> They
disclaimed any intention of aiming at independence, protested their
loyalty to the king, and their attachment to the house of Hanover,
which they ranked "among our most singular blessings."</p>

<p>All congress desired was the rights belonging to them as
British subjects. They proposed to establish a postal courier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
between New York and either Ticonderoga or Crown Point, leaving
it to Canadians to open a communication between Montreal and
such of these two places as might be decided upon.</p>

<p>When the American troops, continuing their advance northward,
captured Montreal, Franklin established a post office there,
appointing as postmaster George Measam, who afterwards entered
the American service.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In the ledger kept by Franklin, as postmaster
general of the United Colonies, the account of the postmaster
of Montreal appears in its place among the colonial post
offices. The postage on letters from New York to Montreal was
fixed at four pennyweight, and to Quebec at five pennyweight.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Until relief arrived, Finlay was confined within the walls of
Quebec, and Foxcroft's usefulness was equally curtailed by the
fact that he and Dashwood, the departmental secretary, were held
prisoners at New York.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> While the British were being thus deprived
of all the usual means of communication, the American
service was being put in a high state of efficiency.</p>

<p>In this, as in other respects, the colonists were fortunate in
having the services of Franklin. In August, following upon the
proclamation of independence, Franklin was directed to arrange
a system of communications whereby post riders were placed at
intervals of twenty-five or thirty miles over the whole stretch
from Falmouth (now Portland) to Georgia, the mails being carried
from post to post from one end of the country to the other, three
times a week.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The riders were to travel night as well as day, and there was
to be no more delay at the changing posts than was necessary to
pass the mails from one rider to the other. Three advice boats,
also, were employed to run from North Carolina, South Carolina
and Georgia to the place of assembly of the continental congress.</p>

<p>After the royal post office was driven off the mainland, it took
refuge on one of the war vessels, which lay in New York harbour.
The postmaster of New York received and opened the mails on
board the ship, and all letters were advertised, so that they might
be obtained either directly or through friends. The Americans,
however, had a keen sense of the importance of communications,
and from the beginning of the struggle, made every effort to intercept
the packets.</p>

<p>Early in May 1775, while the more cautious Americans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
opposing any step that would lead to extremities, Finlay reported
that he was on board the ship "King Fisher," and that a vessel
manned by sixty resolute fellows was cruising about Sandy Hook,
in the hope of intercepting the packet "Mercury," which was due
to arrive.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the burning of Falmouth by a British naval
expedition, letters of marque and reprisal were issued in November
by the province of Massachusetts Bay; and in the following
March, the continental congress sanctioned the fitting out of
private armed vessels to prey upon British commerce.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Seaport
towns were enjoined that on no account should they furnish provisions
to war vessels coming to them.</p>

<p>The ministry were under no delusions as to the situation. At
the end of September, the packets were withdrawn from general
post office duty, armed as for war, and placed at the orders of the
war office. The movements of the packets were clothed with
secrecy, and it was only when the vessels were bound for Halifax
that the public were notified that a mail was being despatched.
From Halifax, the mails were taken by the first opportunity to
Boston or New York.</p>

<p>The attitude of the post office to all these preparations for war
was very curious. It seemed incapable of understanding why
exceptional measures were necessary at that time. A steady
murmur of discontent was kept up against the war office.
Remonstrance after remonstrance was directed against the commander-in-chief
for the detention of the packets beyond what
seemed a reasonable delay, and there was continual complaint
against the restrictions placed upon the post office.</p>

<p>Until the middle of the year 1776, although the service had
been on a complete war footing for some months past, there had
been no actual clash between the British and American vessels.
The correspondence, however, reveals a state of great anxiety
for the safety of the despatches, and as the vessels put out, the
masters were placed under strict injunctions to sink the mails if
there was any likelihood of capture.</p>

<p>The first recorded engagement in which the packets on any of
the North American stations were concerned, took place on the
17th of July. The master of the "Lord Hyde" reported<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that on
his passage from Falmouth to New York, he saw at four o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in the morning of that day a ship and a brig three or four leagues
distant. They spoke to one another, and then gave chase to the
packet. The ship fell out of sight, but the brig followed hard,
and at four in the afternoon came up with the packet and began
to fire, at the same time running a red English ensign to the topmast
head.</p>

<p>The master of the packet, seeing no chance for escape, shortened
sail and prepared for action. The brig came up alongside, replacing
the English ensign by a flag of thirteen stripes with a small union
in it, and without more ado poured into the packet a broadside
from eight carriage guns, and a number of swivels and small arms.
The packet returning the fire, a warm engagement followed for an
hour and a half at a distance of fifty or sixty yards. The brig
then bore away. The packet was much shattered in her sails
and rigging, but wonderful to relate, the only casualties were the
slight wounding of five persons.</p>

<p>The "Sandwich" packet, which left New York on the 20th of
August, reported<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> an encounter with a fast schooner bearing the
New England colours, a white field with a pine tree in the middle.
After some manoeuvring, in which it appeared that the plan of the
schooner was to keep in the wake of the packet outside the range
of the latter's guns, but near enough to take advantage of the
superior weight of her own guns, the packet managed to bring the
schooner into an action which lasted for nearly two hours. The
rigging, sails and masts of both vessels were much damaged, but
the packet came out of the encounter without any person being
even wounded.</p>

<p>The third engagement was a more serious affair. The packet
"Harriott," on the New York station, was attacked on the 17th
of September by a privateer of twelve guns and over one hundred
men. The packet, which was armed and equipped in the same
manner as the other packets on this station, had twelve guns, but
only forty-five men. Of these five were killed, including the captain,
and nine were wounded. Through the gallantry of the
mate, Spargo, the packet managed to avoid capture. For his
good conduct on this occasion, Spargo was made master of the
"Harriott."</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1778, the "Harriott," in violation, it would
seem, of the instructions given to all the masters of packets to
avoid a fight, if possible, captured the American vessel "Sea
Nymph," of one hundred and twenty tons burden, laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
gunpowder, saltpetre, gun flints and other wares, and brought it
into New York.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>While the packet boats were thus occupied in foiling the
enemy's attempts upon them, the course of events had restored
to the post office a footing on land in America. The arrival of
assistance from England in May enabled Carleton to attack the
American force which had held Quebec in siege since the November
previous, and the retreat of the Americans which ensued was not
stayed until they had been driven entirely out of Canada.</p>

<p>Finlay, who had spent the winter in Quebec, and who has been
credited with one of the best anonymous accounts which have
come down to us of the conditions of the city during the siege, at
once prepared to resume his duties as deputy postmaster general.
New York, also, fell again into the hands of the British, owing to
the withdrawal of Washington's army in September, before the
superior forces of Howe.</p>

<p>Here Foxcroft, the deputy postmaster general, and Dashwood,
the departmental secretary, were prisoners of war; and Antill,
the postmaster of New York, had taken up quarters in one of the
war vessels in the harbour. Antill lost no time in returning to the
city; and Foxcroft and Dashwood were set free by an exchange
for two American officers which took place shortly after.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Like Finlay, Foxcroft made preparations for the resumption of
business; but for both Finlay and Foxcroft an unexpected thing
happened. Vessels with mails began to arrive at Quebec and
New York, but the mails were not taken to the post office, although
the statute laid it upon shipmasters as their duty to deliver the
mails at the post office before they broke bulk.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> On the arrival
of the vessels, the commanders-in-chief directed the masters to
send the letters up to their headquarters, where they were gone
over by confidential officers, on whom were imposed the duties
of handling the incoming mails.</p>

<p>The reason of this step will be sufficiently obvious, although
the post office professed that they had never seen any good purpose
served by it. Even where there was no suggestion of disloyalty
among the citizens, there were infinite possibilities of harm in
the unguarded utterances, which are constantly occurring in
familiar letters. Matters, which it is of the highest importance
to keep concealed from the enemy, may be within the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of every citizen, and it becomes necessary either to induce or to
compel citizens not to write of such matters.</p>

<p>But it was not only against the undesigned harm which loyal
people might do, that it was necessary to guard. There was good
reason to suspect that in Quebec, as well as in New York, there
was a considerable proportion of English speaking people who
were by no means well affected towards the government, and who
would not hesitate to impart to the enemy any information which
they thought might be of assistance.</p>

<p>The king, in his instructions to Carleton<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> as governor, enjoined
him to signify to the loyal merchants and planters the necessity
for caution against allowing their letters to become the means of
conveying information to the enemy, and directed him to use every
possible effort to frustrate the schemes of the disloyal carried on
through the medium of correspondence.</p>

<p>The method employed by the governor to forestall danger from
this source was the simple one of standing guard over the channel
through which correspondence must ordinarily pass. In this way,
he would discover many of the disaffected, and at the same time
show such people the danger to them of being implicated in matters
of that kind.</p>

<p>To merchants, however, the governor's course was a great
inconvenience. All their letters were delayed, and many not
delivered at all, for the governor's staff had neither the training
in post office work, nor the sense of the importance of mercantile
correspondence necessary to assure the merchants of the safety of
their letters, when these passed out of the accustomed courses.
The merchants remonstrated against the governor's action, and
called upon Finlay to assert the determination of the post office
to secure respect for the act, which was being violated by the
governor.</p>

<p>Finlay was a man of tact, and a member of the governor's
executive council as well, and he counselled patience to the merchants.
They acquiesced for a time, hoping that the governor's
surveillance over their correspondence would be relaxed, but the
governor continued firm. Each season as the vessels began to
come up the river, orders were issued for the renewal of the
unpopular practice.</p>

<p>What took place at Quebec was repeated at New York; and
during the short period of the British occupation of Philadelphia,
in that city, also. The postmaster of Philadelphia, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
retired to England when the British office was closed in 1775,
returned on hearing that the city was again in the king's hands,
but only to find that the letters were delivered to the commander-in-chief,
who distributed them not only to the army and navy,
but also to the merchants, and no steps were taken to collect the
postage.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>At that time, and indeed until a quite recent date, the postage
on letters was not paid until the delivery of them was effected,
and when, as during the war of the Revolution, the mails were
diverted from their usual channel, the post office was unable to
collect anything to meet the expenses it was incurring.</p>

<p>To-day, owing to the greater cohesiveness among the departments
of government, the post office would rest content in the
fact that the loss of revenue was due to the action of the government
as a whole, and could not be imputed to any failure on its
own part, but, at that time, it viewed the situation as a private
institution would. The loss of revenue seemed to affect it alone,
and again and again the post office declared to the war office
that, unless the revenue was maintained, it would be obliged to
cut off the internal services between Montreal and Quebec.</p>

<p>There was another matter arising out of the governor's lack
of confidence in the English-speaking people in Canada which was
a source of much inconvenience to the deputy postmaster general.
It has been the practice in Canada to grant exemption to postmasters
from the billeting of the troops upon them. The barracks
which had been erected in Montreal were destroyed by fire, and it was
necessary that the soldiers should be provided for by the citizens.
But the duty was grudgingly undertaken, and indeed the disfavour
with which the soldiers were regarded in Montreal was one of the
chief grounds of complaint on the part of the governors.</p>

<p>Exemption from billeting was an ancient privilege of postmasters.
In several of the colonies it was expressly granted, and
the continental congress relieved its postmasters from all military
duties. In Canada the advantages the post office was able to
offer to its postmasters were small and insignificant, and one of
the most valued privileges was the assurance of relief from
billeting.</p>

<p>The postmaster of Montreal complained to Finlay that, in
disregard of the understanding on which he had accepted the
postmastership, an officer and his servant had been quartered upon
him and he demanded their removal. Finlay, nothing doubting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
laid the postmaster's letter before the governor, who, to Finlay's
surprise, took exception to what he termed the extraordinary
and peremptory tone of the letter, and commanded Finlay to
dismiss the postmaster.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>To Finlay this order was a great embarrassment, as suitable
postmasters were difficult to find, and, besides, the postmaster
had accepted the office merely to oblige Finlay. Finlay laid
these facts before the governor and pleaded for a reconsideration,
but the governor was inexorable. Carleton relinquished the
governorship at this time, and Finlay appealed to Haldimand,
who succeeded Carleton, but with no better success.</p>

<p>The post office encountered the same kind of ill-will here as
elsewhere from the military authorities. With the greatest vigilance
on their part, much correspondence was passing backward
and forward of which they could know nothing, and the suspicions
natural under the circumstances were heightened by what they
knew of the opinions of many of the people.</p>

<p>The regularity of the trips between Quebec and Montreal,
which were resumed soon after the Americans had withdrawn
from the country, seemed to Haldimand a source of danger.
Although there was no large hostile force in the province, affairs
were still unsettled, and a mail courier whose movements were
known in every detail could easily be waylaid by the marauding
parties which infested the long route on the banks of the St.
Lawrence. Haldimand would have preferred holding the regular
service in suspense until peace was obtained, depending on occasional
expresses to maintain necessary communications.</p>

<p>During the year 1777 there was no material change in the
situation. When the British occupied New York in the autumn
of 1776, the monthly trips between England and New York were
resumed. But the activity of the privateers was greatly increased;
and while none of the packets on the New York station were taken,
the "Swallow" on its way to Lisbon in February was captured by
the war vessel which had carried Franklin to France,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and the
"Weymouth," which was taking the mails from the West Indies
was obliged to strike to the "Oliver Cromwell" of New London,
a privateer carrying twenty guns and one hundred and fifty-three
men.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>France, though not at war with England, saw in the revolt
of the colonies an opportunity for revenge for late humiliations,
and she strained the laws of neutrality to the utmost in her effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to assist the Americans. Cruisers bearing American names, but
armed with French guns, and manned by French sailors ranging
the channel, wrought havoc with British merchant shipping,
and carried their prizes into the harbours of Normandy and
Brittany.</p>

<p>Some regard, however, had to be paid to appearances so long
as France had not actually broken with England; and it was not
until the alliance between the Americans and the French was
consummated in February 1778, that the hands of the French
were quite free.</p>

<p>From that time England's position on the sea was changed
greatly for the worse, and the record of the packet service was
one of almost unbroken disaster. On the 15th of June the packet
"Le Despencer" on her way from Falmouth to New York, was
set upon by two privateers, the "Nancy" with sixteen guns and
one hundred and twenty men, and another having fourteen guns
and one hundred and fifteen men. After an hour's fighting, in
which his vessel was disabled, the captain of the "Le Despencer"
was obliged to yield to superior force.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In September, the "Duke of York," on one of the North
American stations, was taken by a French frigate of thirty-six
guns;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and in the same month, the "Harriott" and the "Eagle,"
the one bound for New York, and the other for Carolina, both fell
as prizes to the "Vengeance," a privateer of twenty guns and one
hundred and ten men, belonging to Paul Jones' fleet and commanded
by a Frenchman, Captain Ricot.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>From the year 1779 until 1782, nine packets on the several
North American stations were captured, and seven were more or
less seriously damaged. Some idea of the extent to which the
packet service was crippled during the war of the Revolution may
be gathered from the fact that of the five vessels on the New York
station in 1777, four were taken and one damaged. Of the six
on the West Indian station, four were taken and one damaged,
and of the three on the Carolina station two were taken.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
importance of these facts in their influence on the outcome of
the war has not so far received the attention the subject merits.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Beginnings of exclusively Canadian postal service&mdash;Administration of Hugh
Finlay&mdash;Opening of communication with England by way of Halifax&mdash;Postal
convention with United States.</p></div>


<p>A point has now been reached, beyond which the sequence of
events in the American post office no longer forms an integral part
of the narrative. There had, indeed, been no actual postal connection
between Canada and the revolted colonies since the beginning
of war. Communication between Quebec, Montreal and
New York had been interrupted in May 1775 by the capture of
Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>The abandonment of the colonial post office by the home
authorities at the end of the same year, left the four post offices
on the banks of the St. Lawrence the sole remnants of the system
which had extended from Quebec to Georgia. Though Finlay was
nominally the associate deputy postmaster general for the district
between Canada and the southern boundary of Virginia, his real
authority was confined to the service of Quebec, Three Rivers,
Berthier and Montreal.</p>

<p>Finlay occupied important positions in the government of the
country, from his arrival in the year when Canada fell into the
hands of the British, until his death in 1801. His knowledge of
the French language procured for him a nomination as justice
of the peace, the duties of which office were, owing to the circumstances
of the time, delicate and responsible.</p>

<p>Two years after a regular government was established, Finlay
was nominated to the legislative council, and a glance over the
proceedings of that body will show that he always took an important,
and often a leading part in its transactions. He was
clerk of the crown in chancery and provincial auditor, and, for a
number of years, chairman of the land committee, the duties of
which were to superintend the distribution of the crown lands to
the settlers, who came into the country in large numbers.</p>

<p>Finlay was much attached to the French Canadians. He
became their advocate in council, and incurred some displeasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
on the part of the governor for his pertinacity on their behalf. The
<i>maîtres de poste</i> were the objects of his special attention. He
endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to assimilate their position
to that of the masters of the post houses in England. As their
standing and rights were but roughly defined, they had to endure
much hardship and oppression from the ill-nature and rapacity
of travellers, and Finlay's championship was of substantial service
to them.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>When Canada was invaded by the Americans in 1775, Finlay
drew up a form of pledge for the <i>maîtres de poste</i> to sign, in which
they bound themselves to defend the country from the king's
enemies, to give to the government all useful information they
might become possessed of, and to render faithful service in the
conveyance of the mail couriers. All the <i>maîtres de poste</i> except
three signed the engagement.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>To Finlay, in truth, the maintenance of the organization of
<i>maîtres de poste</i> was indispensable. Without them the mails could
not be carried, except at an outlay which the revenues were not
able to bear. It has always been the practice of the post office
in this country to take advantage of any carrying agencies which
might be operating on a route, to secure the transportation of the
mails on approximately the same terms as those at which ordinary
freight of the same bulk would be conveyed. Thus, by utilizing a
stage coach, the cost of conveyance between two towns was a mere
fraction of what it would be, if the same conditions of speed and
security were required in a conveyance used exclusively for the
mails.</p>

<p>In the <i>maîtres de poste</i> Finlay had a transportation agency,
which was unexcelled at that period, and by protecting them and
confirming to them the exclusive right to provide for passenger
travel along the road from Montreal to Quebec, he obtained not
only all the ordinary advantages accruing to the public from the
operation of this agency, but secured the conveyance of his couriers
from stage to stage at half the charge paid by travellers.</p>

<p>Finlay's efforts on behalf of the <i>maîtres de poste</i> were first exerted
in the legislative council.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> He desired to obtain an ordinance
defining their duties, and declaring their right to the exclusive
privilege of providing horses and vehicles to travellers. Having
succeeded in this, he endeavoured to have himself appointed
superintendent of the <i>maîtres de poste</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>In this he had to encounter the opposition of the governor who,
though personally friendly to Finlay, was unwilling to allow himself
to be occupied with the matter, while he was engaged with the more
important duty of providing for the defence of the country. Finlay
was a man of much persistence, and when he found the governor
indisposed to give him the appointment, he sought the aid of the
postmaster general, to whom he represented that on his control
over the <i>maîtres de poste</i> depended his ability to secure the conveyance
of the mails at a reasonable charge.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Governor Haldimand resented the pressure thus brought on
him, declaring that the postal service of Canada was quite equal,
if not superior, to the service in England. Not long afterwards,
however, the governor relented so far as to give Finlay a temporary
holding of the position he coveted, and when conditions became
settled, his appointment was made permanent.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The stoppage of the service to New York made it necessary
to provide otherwise for the maintenance of the connection with
Great Britain. While navigation was open on the St. Lawrence
occasional visits were made to Quebec by war vessels and merchantmen,
and all such opportunities to send mails to England were
taken advantage of.</p>

<p>With Halifax, also, communication was opened by means of
a vessel which ran from Quebec to Tatamagouche, on the straits
of Northumberland, from which point the journey to Halifax was
an easy overland trip.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> During the summer, therefore, communication
with Great Britain was maintained without special
difficulty. When navigation on the St. Lawrence closed, however,
and vessels could no longer reach Quebec, the situation was entirely
changed.</p>

<p>Haldimand, in a letter to a friend, written in November 1778,
bemoans his isolation. He will receive no news whatever, unless
the rebels should manage to get into the province, an eventuality
he has done his best to prevent by destroying their supplies on
lake Champlain. The only possible means of establishing a winter
communication with Great Britain was to send couriers by the
inland route to Halifax.</p>

<p>At this period and for a long time afterwards, this route presented
many difficulties. It was very long, and at certain seasons
the natural obstacles in the way of travel were nearly insuperable.
The connecting links between the Maritime provinces and Quebec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
were the portages between the waters running into the St. Lawrence
and those running into the St. John river. Of those there were
several, but the one which was adopted ran from Notre Dame du
Portage, a few miles west of River du Loup, in south-easterly
direction until it reached lake Temiscouata.</p>

<p>During the French regime, despatches were not infrequently
carried between the governor of Quebec and the governor of
Louisburg. The courier, who had despatches from the governor
of Quebec for Halifax, would travel on foot over a fair road on the
south shore of the St. Lawrence, to the portage between Kamouraska
and River du Loup. From this point his course ran over
the portage between the St. Lawrence and the St. John river
systems.</p>

<p>After a toilsome journey of thirty-seven miles over a country
alternating between mountains and swamps, the courier reached
lake Temiscouata. Having crossed this lake, he came to the
entrance of the Madawaska river, which runs due south until it
empties into the St. John river. From this point to fort Howe,
the site of the present city of St. John, there was a long river
journey of two hundred and twenty-eight miles.</p>

<p>The trip from St. John to Halifax took the courier across the
bay of Fundy to Annapolis, thence along the Annapolis valley to
Windsor, and so on to Halifax. The distance from Quebec to
Halifax by this route was six hundred and twenty-seven miles.
This route was followed frequently by couriers during the winters
of the years of the war of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In 1775, Finlay proposed to introduce some system into the
arrangements by having couriers from Quebec and Halifax meet
at fort Howe for the exchange of despatches. While the war
lasted, the arrangement was to be kept secret. In 1781, the
merchants in London who traded to Quebec urged the adoption
of this route for a regular winter service, but the danger of having
the couriers intercepted by prowling parties of Americans on the
long unprotected stretches made it impossible to have more than
an occasional trip. The trips, also, cost at least £100 each, a not
unimportant consideration in those days.</p>

<p>Finlay's activity as deputy postmaster general was confined
to the inland service in Canada, and he gave his attention to
improving the conditions under which the service was performed.
The state of the roads was a matter which occupied him considerably.
They were probably, as Finlay reported, as bad as they
could be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>For many years before Canada passed into the possession of
the British, the habitants were fully occupied with the war, and
when peace was restored, the roads remained as the war had left
them. Work on the roads was never willingly undertaken by the
habitants. When Lanoullier constructed the great highway
between Montreal and Quebec, it was only by his personal superintendence
that he was able to keep the habitant to his task. As
soon as his eye was withdrawn the work lagged.</p>

<p>Lanoullier lived until 1751, and during the last few years of
his service he failed to maintain the energy that had been an
earlier characteristic; and after his death, the country was in a
constant state of war, so that even if there had been an efficient
grand voyer to succeed him, the general neglect into which the
domestic affairs fell must have affected the condition of the roads.</p>

<p>The procedure employed in calling upon the habitants to work
upon the roads was that the grand voyer issued an order to the
local captains of militia, who published the order to the habitants
by notice at the church doors. The grand voyer complained to
Finlay that it was impossible to induce the habitants to work upon
the roads. When the order was read at the church, the habitants
would dismiss the matter with a shrug, and the remark "c'est un
ordre anglais."</p>

<p>The consequence of this neglect was seen in the details of
Finlay's reports<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> as he travelled from Quebec to Montreal. As he
passes from post house to post house, his journals are a monotonous,
though indignant, recital of ruts, bogs and rocks.</p>

<p>The roads were unditched, and the bridges dangerous trap
holes. The bridges were no more than rows of poles lying crosswise,
and scarcely longer than the width of a <i>calèche</i>. When the
water rose, the poles were set afloat. The post houses should have
been three leagues apart, but the difficulty of inducing the habitants
to undertake the irksome and thankless duties of <i>maître de poste</i>,
often compelled Finlay to choose persons whose houses were at a
considerable distance from where they should have been, and
consequently post houses were found quite close together.</p>

<p>There were places where the post houses were no more than one
league apart. As a <i>maître de poste</i> could not carry passengers
beyond the next adjoining post house, the inconvenience of the
frequent changes of horses was very great.</p>

<p>The mail couriers were bound to travel by night as well as by
day; and it is not difficult to believe Finlay when he says that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
courier travels by night at the risk of his neck. When other means
of obtaining help with the road work failed, Finlay offered to put
the road in good condition and keep it so if given the services of
twelve soldiers of the German legion, and a grant of £100.</p>

<p>An application was made to Finlay in 1781 for a postal service
to the settlements and forts along the Richelieu river. This was
one of the most prosperous sections of the country. When
Catalogne made his report on the state of Canada in 1712, he was
particularly struck with the evidences of comfort in some of the
parishes bordering on the Richelieu.</p>

<p>It was not on this account, however, that it was thought
necessary to extend to this district the benefits of the postal service.
The valley of the Richelieu was the pathway along which travel
from lake Champlain pursued its course into the heart of Canada.
Settlements were established along the river at different times by
French and English to oppose a barrier to incursions from the
south.</p>

<p>British forces were stationed in 1761 at St. Johns, Chambly
and Sorel; and it was to keep up a communication with these
forces that a postal service was desired. The detachments at St.
Johns and Chambly received their letters and despatches from
Montreal, but as the most important communications were with the
governor, whose headquarters were at Quebec, the commandant
of the forces in this district, Colonel St. Leger, wished to have a
regular exchange with Sorel at the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>Although Sorel was on the south side of the St. Lawrence, it
had maintained connection with the couriers on the grand route
between Quebec and Montreal, by means of a courier who crossed
the river to Berthier, where a post office had been established since
1772. The postmaster general was disinclined to open a route
between Sorel and St. Johns, and the military authorities took the
matter into their own hands.</p>

<p>The conclusion of peace in 1783 and the recognition of the
independence of the United States was immediately followed by
the dissolution of the old establishment which administered the
postal system of the northern district of North America. The
services of Finlay, as deputy postmaster general of that system,
ceased forthwith; and in July 1784, he was appointed to the much
humbler position of deputy postmaster general of Canada.</p>

<p>Foxcroft, Finlay's associate in the deputyship was made
British agent at New York for the packet boat service, which
was resumed between Great Britain and the United States. Dashwood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the departmental secretary of the old establishment, was
appointed postmaster general of Jamaica in 1781.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The first question of importance to occupy Finlay under the
new order of things was the means by which communication
between Great Britain and Canada was thereafter to be carried
on. The merchants of Quebec and Montreal hearing that a line
of sailing packets was to be re-established between Falmouth
and New York,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> at once demanded that the service between
Canada and New York should be restored.</p>

<p>Conditions were not favourable to its resumption. The rancours
of the war were not yet abated, and one or two messengers, who
were sent down to New York by Finlay, were insulted and maltreated
by the Americans. The postmaster general of the United
States, Hazzard, also set up difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Finlay's plan was to have the Canadian mails taken down as
far as Albany by his courier, and to pay the American postage on
them from Albany to New York. But at this time there were
no regular couriers between Albany and New York; and consequently
the Canadian mails, having to depend on chance conveyance,
would often miss the packet boats for which they were
intended. Finlay thought to overcome this difficulty by having
his courier take the mails past Albany and on to New York.</p>

<p>Hazzard, however, objected to this plan, and informed Finlay
that he would have the courier prosecuted if he attempted to go
farther south than Albany. Finlay met this objection, but at
a ruinous cost. He arranged with the postmaster at Albany that
the Canadian courier should go on to New York, and that at
the same time Finlay would pay for this privilege at the rate of
three shillings sterling per ounce for the mail, the bag being
included in the weight. Thus, if the mail bag weighed twenty
pounds&mdash;no very great weight&mdash;Finlay had to pay £48, the cost
of wayleave for his courier to travel from Albany to New York.
He had, of course, to pay his courier's expenses as well.</p>

<p>Nor did the situation show a prospect of improvement. The
United States perceived that the toll which the Canadian post
office would have to pay for leave to pass over their territory
might be greatly increased by the simple expedient of establishing
a post office near the Canadian boundary, and compelling the
Canadian post office to pay a wayleave equal to the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
postage for the distance between that post office and New York,
as well as the courier's wages and necessary expenses, for the
Americans did not propose to be at any expense in the matter.
This scheme would net the Americans four shillings an ounce.</p>

<p>But as has happened so often since in the relations of Canada
with her neighbour to the south, the Canadian post office was
driven by these oppressive charges to the development of the
alternative, though naturally much less favourable, opening to
the sea. The distance from Quebec to Halifax by the Temiscouata
route was six hundred and twenty-seven miles as against rather
less than four hundred miles, which is the distance from Montreal
to New York.</p>

<p>The route to New York was the natural highway, which for a
century and more had been pursued by Indians, soldiers and
travellers on their way from the British American colonies to
Canada. On the journey southward from Montreal to New York,
there was a good road from Laprairie, opposite Montreal to fort
St. John, which was connected by the river Richelieu with lake
Champlain.</p>

<p>The trip down the lake from fort St. John to Crown Point (or
fort Frederic) was easily and pleasantly made by canoe or <i>bateau</i>.
From Crown Point, the traveller had a choice of routes to the
Hudson river, which bore him to New York. Kalm, the Swedish
naturalist who visited Canada in 1749, entered the country by the
route described, and his account of the trip suggests no unusual
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Before the war the mail couriers from Montreal to New York
made the journey in from nine to ten days. The journey to
Halifax was of a very different character. At the best it could
not be made in less than a month, and during a considerable
period at the beginning and the end of each winter season the
trip was very arduous and dangerous.</p>

<p>There has been preserved the journal of a courier, Durand,
who carried a mail from Quebec to Halifax and back in the early
winter months of 1784.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> His trip downwards, starting on the
11th of January, offered no features unusual in a winter journey,
most of which must be made on foot through a country a large
part of which was unsettled. He reached Halifax on the 29th
of February, seven weeks from starting.</p>

<p>The journey homeward was exceedingly toilsome and dangerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and as conditions remained unchanged for many years, at this
season when winter was relaxing its hold, it may be worth while
to note some of the incidents on the route.</p>

<p>At the Bay du Portage, on the lower St. John, Durand and his
three companions broke through the ice, and they with their
mails were rescued with difficulty. They managed to get as far
as Presqu' Isle, partly on the honeycombed ice, and partly in the
woods, when they found themselves face to face with an ice jam.
As it was impossible for Durand to land his dogs on the shore,
he clambered up the hill of ice, and he and the dogs had to make
their way as best they could over the broken heaped-up pieces
for twenty miles, when they came upon a stretch of water as
clear as in summer.</p>

<p>Durand's guide had abandoned him and taken to the woods,
but finding the snow too soft for his snow-shoes, after a league's
trudging, he rejoined Durand on the ice. The swift and swollen
waters, which they now reached, compelled them to wait till they
could build a canoe. Embarking they poled their way for a
couple of miles, as the speed of the current prevented rowing,
when the ice began again to come down upon them in great masses.</p>

<p>Harnessing their dogs to an Indian cart, they hauled their
canoe another stretch, and on the 14th of April they reached Grand
Falls. Above the falls the ice, though bad, was firm enough;
and having constructed a sled, they carried their canoe and baggage
on it for fifteen leagues. From this point onward, although their
difficulties were by no means at an end, they struggled on to the
St. Lawrence, and reached Quebec on the 24th of April.</p>

<p>The trip was a great disappointment to Finlay. He had no
intention of having it made at this time; but Sir John Johnston,
superintendent general of Indian affairs, had informed him that
he was about to make a trip to Halifax, and would be prepared
to take a mail with him. Finlay lost no time in advertising the
fact throughout the colony, and had gathered a large number of
letters when Johnston changed his plans and did not go to Halifax.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Finlay to do but to send a special courier.
Durand whom he engaged could not tell him what the cost would
be, but from the figures furnished by another courier who had
frequently carried despatches, he thought that £120 would be
about the expense. Imagine his dismay when the account was
shown to be £191, and he had collected less than £75 as postage
on the letters contained in the mail.</p>

<p>There was no choice open to the colony. At whatever cost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
an easy road must be made between Quebec and Halifax. Dependence
on a foreign, and, at the time, hostile nation, for communication
with the mother country was not to be thought of,
still less endured.</p>

<p>Indeed, in January 1783, before the peace was signed, Haldimand
had taken steps to establish a road between Canada and
Nova Scotia. He sent a surveyor with two hundred men down
to work on the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Temiscoueta'">Temiscouata</ins> portage, and at the same time urged
governor Parr of Nova Scotia to do what was necessary to
facilitate travel in his province.</p>

<p>Haldimand had observed that a considerable part of the
expense of a mail service by this route arose from the extortionate
charges for guides and forwarding, which were made by the Acadians
settled at Aupaque, a few miles above Fredericton.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> His plan,
therefore, was to gather into his own hands all the agencies for
transportation on the route; and with that end in view, he proposed
to establish some experienced men at the head of lake
Temiscouata, with canoes and other facilities for travel, whose
business it should be to convey passengers and mail couriers
across the lake, down the Madawaska river, and on down the
St. John river as far as Grand Falls, where he intended to settle
another post.</p>

<p>From an Acadian courier, named Mercure, whom Haldimand
frequently employed to convey despatches to Halifax, he learned
that a number of Acadians desired to take up land on the upper
St. John, in order that they might be nearer ministers of religion,
in the parishes on the St. Lawrence. The plan was to place these
Acadians on the lands along the river from Grand Falls up to lake
Temiscouata, and it was hoped that the settlement thus formed
would extend eventually to the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The governor of Nova Scotia responded heartily to Haldimand's
proposals, and the settlement, once begun under their united
efforts, made rapid progress. When Finlay travelled by this route
to Halifax in July 1787, he found no settlers at all on the Madawaska,
and only some twenty Acadians huddled together on the
south bank of the St. John, opposite the mouth of the Madawaska.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>From this point downwards to the Grand Falls, a distance of
forty miles, the country was entirely unoccupied. In 1791, a
gentleman from Scotland, who was making a tour through Canada
remarked with satisfaction on the regularity of the settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
over an extent of fifty miles of very rich country, and on the
evidences of material well-being observable on every side.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The
people carried the modes of life of a self-dependent community
with them, as the traveller says that the settlement was entirely
isolated and self-contained, electing its own magistrates, and that
a high degree of comfort prevailed.</p>

<p>Governor Carleton, of New Brunswick, who had assisted materially
in the formation of the settlement, obtained a troop of soldiers
from Lord Dorchester, and by manning the posts at Presqu' Isle,
Fredericton and St. John, he provided the means for keeping the
road in good order.</p>

<p>The section of the long route between Quebec and Halifax,
which commenced at the northern end of the Temiscouata portage,
and ended at the mouth of the St. John river, was the one presenting
most difficulties. But the other parts of the route, that
is, the section between Quebec and the Temiscouata portage,
which was entirely within the jurisdiction of the governor of
Quebec, and the section from St. John to Halifax, which was
partly in New Brunswick, and partly in Nova Scotia, remain to
be mentioned.</p>

<p>The courier had a comparatively easy journey from Quebec
down the south shore of the St. Lawrence to the entrance of the
portage. There had been a fair road for some years through
that part of the country, and in 1786 Finlay, by the governor's
orders, settled post houses on the route in order to facilitate the
travel of mail couriers and others. The gentleman whose travels
through Canada have been mentioned, observed that it was a
comfortable trip through these parts, and that the country was
thickly settled, there being from twelve to sixteen families to
the mile.</p>

<p>The eastern end of the long route, that is, the part from St.
John to Halifax, consisted of a trip across the bay of Fundy from
St. John to Annapolis, and a journey by land through the Annapolis
valley from Annapolis to Windsor, thence to Halifax. The
road from Annapolis to Halifax is described by Finlay as very
rough, but it was covered in three days in a one-horse carriage,
and in two days on horseback.</p>

<p>The maintenance of a continuous communication between
Quebec and Halifax was effected in the following manner.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Canada
controlled the section from Quebec to Fredericton, and provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
couriers who made fortnightly trips over this part of the route.
The section down the St. John river from Fredericton to St. John,
and thence by the bay to Annapolis, was under the supervision
of the government of New Brunswick; while the eastern part,
which lay entirely in Nova Scotia, was naturally managed by
that government. In the summer of 1787, the governor, Lord
Dorchester, sent Finlay over the route to Halifax, to see what
improvements would be required in order to enable this service
to compete with the service over the shorter route from Montreal
to New York. Dorchester at the same time submitted the whole
scheme to the colonial office, intimating that if the home government
saw fit to establish a packet service between England and
Halifax, the arrangements for the inland conveyance through the
provinces would be found satisfactory.</p>

<p>Lord Sydney, the colonial secretary, expressed the king's
approval of the measures taken,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and stated that the postmasters
general had directed Finlay to carry the plans into execution
in a manner correspondent to Lord Dorchester's wishes. The
lack of sufficient packet boats would prevent the establishment
of a regular service from England for the moment, but it was
hoped that vessels enough might be spared for the route, to make
the service though not exactly regular yet of substantial benefit
to the colonies.</p>

<p>Finlay in the course of his visit to St. John and Halifax found
much to encourage the hope that, with the improvement of the
route, a satisfactory outlet from Canada to the sea would be
obtained at Halifax. The chief trouble, he foresaw, lay in the
divided responsibility for the maintenance of an efficient service,
owing to the fact that post office authorities in the several provinces
were entirely independent of one another. Indeed, at that
very time, the deputy postmasters general of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia were at strife with one another, and were carrying
on an active newspaper war as to which of the two was accountable
for certain defects in the service.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The distribution of the
expense of the part of the service they had undertaken to maintain
was another cause of complaint.</p>

<p>Finlay came back to Canada after his trip to Halifax bringing
with him two strong convictions. One was that the service to be
successful must be in the hands of one person. The other was that
the correspondence between the provinces themselves was not of
sufficient volume to cover the outlay, and that unless there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
frequent English mails exchanged at Halifax, the service would
have to be dropped for lack of revenue to meet the large expense.
He considered that if six mails a year could be exchanged between
England and Halifax, the postage arising would more than pay
the expenses of the service.</p>

<p>Dorchester lost no time in transmitting to England the substance
of Finlay's recommendations, adding his own opinion that
as soon as a continuous road to St. John had been constructed,
and a sufficient number of people had been settled upon it to keep
it open in winter, the foot couriers would be replaced by horsemen,
and then the mails would be carried more speedily and securely
than by way of New York.</p>

<p>The governor, also, suggested that the postal service in all the
provinces be put under the direction of Finlay, who was a man
of much experience, zeal, and practical ability, and who was
entitled to this consideration from having lost a similar appointment
by the late war.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The home government approved of Dorchester's recommendation
as to Finlay, whose commission as deputy postmaster general
was extended to comprise the whole of the colonies in British
North America. At the same time Dorchester received the gratifying
news that the post office had managed so to arrange matters
that commencing with March 1788 the packet boats which ran
between Falmouth and New York would pass by way of Halifax,
stopping there two days on both the inward and the outward
voyages.</p>

<p>The service to Halifax was to be limited, however, to eight
monthly trips between March and October, as the admiralty
had been informed that the prevailing winds off the Nova Scotia
coast during the winter months were so contrary as to make
it impracticable for the packets to call there during those
months.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>In winter, therefore, it was still necessary to send the mails
from Canada for England by way of New York. The mails between
Nova Scotia and England during the winter months were exchanged
by means of a schooner, which the governor of Nova
Scotia put on the course between Halifax and New York.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1790, the conditions were made somewhat
easier for the Nova Scotians, by the British post office directing
that the packet agent at New York should send the Nova Scotia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mails from New York to Boston, so that the governor's schooner
was not required to go further south than Boston.</p>

<p>To Canada, the calling of the packet at Halifax, was a great
boon. It settled the seaport problem, which had many perplexing
aspects. Canada could never dispense with the New York
route, unless the charges for transmission through the United
States were made quite extortionate, and the success which had
attended the efforts of Canada to make an outlet through British
territory would not be lost upon the Americans when it became
necessary to re-arrange the terms for transit through the United
States.</p>

<p>To merchants and others in Quebec who depended exclusively
on the Halifax post office for their correspondence with England,
the service of the packet boats, curiously enough, developed a
grievance, which had a real foundation, as will be seen from the
following case.</p>

<p>The postmaster of Halifax reported to the postmaster general
that the admiral of the "Leander," which was on the point of
sailing for England, expressed much dissatisfaction because a mail
was not sent by his ship.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In explanation of his refusal to do
this the postmaster stated that before the packet boats began
to call at Halifax, he made up and despatched a mail by every ship
of war and merchantman that sailed from Halifax for England,
but since the commencement of the packet service, he despatched
no mails by any other vessels than the packets.</p>

<p>The understanding of the arrangement by the postmaster
was that the packet boats would not have been sent to Halifax
if they were not to be employed exclusively, and he would no
more think of sending a mail by any other steamer than he would
send the letters to Annapolis by the first traveller who happened
to be going in that direction. The explanation was acceptable
to both the post office and the admiralty, but there can be no
question that the employment of the packet boats curtailed the
opportunities which the Nova Scotians had enjoyed of corresponding
with England.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Quebec-Halifax service, it seems proper
to mention a remarkable scheme which was submitted to the
postmaster general by William Knox, late under secretary of
state, for a packet service between England and North America,
and between the several parts of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Knox was under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
secretary of state during the war, and had in a large measure
directed the operations of the packet service on behalf of the army
in America.</p>

<p>The proposition, which was the result of a request by Lord
Walsingham, the postmaster general, for an expression of Knox's
views, was based on the sound principle that, until the post office
provided facilities adequate to the requirements of the correspondence
which passed between England and North America, it could
never compete successfully with the number of private ships
continually crossing the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Knox pointed out that there was only a monthly service between
England, Halifax and New York, and that, at the very best, five
months must elapse before an answer could be returned to a
letter written in England and addressed to any of the interior
parts of British North America.</p>

<p>The plan Knox unfolded to Walsingham was to have a fleet
of fast sailing vessels ply between England and Caplin bay, Newfoundland.
At Caplin bay there would be other vessels awaiting
the British packets, and, on their arrival, one of these would
set off with the mails for Halifax and Rhode Island, and another
for Bermuda and Virginia, each vessel returning by its own route,
to Caplin bay. These services were to be looped together by
auxiliary services, and connected with other lines further south,
until Great Britain, Newfoundland, Canada, the United States
and the West Indies were all bound together by an elaborate
system of intercommunication, which would give an exchange
of mails, between all the parts three times a month. This scheme,
it is needless to say, was never carried into execution.</p>

<p>The results of the war had other important consequences for
Canada, besides that of forcing upon Quebec and the Maritime
provinces the first of the series of steps in the direction of common
action, which led eventually to confederation. When peace was
concluded in 1783, the disbanded soldiers and other adherents of
the British cause came and settled in Canada, and there was an
early demand for postal accommodation in the newly peopled
districts.</p>

<p>The first settlement in Upper Canada was at Niagara, where
four or five families took up land in 1780. These were reinforced
in 1784, by a number of the men of Butler's Rangers, and at the
end of that year, the settlement was increased to over six hundred.
Americans came over in large numbers, and between them and
the steady stream inwards of loyalists, the district from Niagara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to the head of the lake at Hamilton was rapidly settled. A
gentleman travelling through that part of the province in 1800
remarked that it was all under settlement.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>At the other end of the province, settlement was going forward
with much rapidity. From the eastern boundary westward as
far as the township of Elizabethtown, near the present site of
Brockville, there was a continuous line of settlers. The extreme
east was taken up by Highland Scotch as far as Dundas county,
and the western part of this county was occupied by Germans.
Both Highlanders and Germans came from the same district on
the Mohawk river in New York state.</p>

<p>Westward from Dundas county the settlers were more largely
of British-American origin. At Elizabethtown there was a break
in the settlement until Frontenac county was reached, as the land
in that intermediate district did not appear so favourable. At
Kingston, settlement was recommended, and from that point to
the western end of the bay of Quinte, farms were taken up with
an alacrity that was unsurpassed in any part of the province.</p>

<p>The incomers were all from the states to the south, and in their
old homes had enjoyed many of the conveniences of civilized life.
In 1787, as soon as they had become fairly established, they
petitioned the government for the extension of the post office
into the new districts, and two years later post offices were opened
at Lachine, Cedars, Coteau du Lac, Charlottenburg, Cornwall,
New Johnston, Lancaster, Osnabruck, Augusta, Elizabethtown
and Kingston.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>This was as far as the regular mail couriers ran. Trips were
made once a year during the winter, and in summer, every opportunity
afforded by vessels going up to lake Ontario, was taken
advantage of for the despatch of mails.</p>

<p>In the first advertisement of the service of the new districts,
it was stated that the mails would be despatched every four weeks,
but this regularity could not be attained without a considerable
outlay, and it was found better to utilize such means of conveyance
as happened to be offering, for the carriage of the mails.
Though the line of post offices along the St. Lawrence terminated
at Kingston, reasonable provision was made for communication
with the remote settlements of Niagara, Detroit and Michillimackinac.</p>

<p>Detroit and Michillimackinac are in the territory of the United
States, but the forts at these places were detained in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of the British until 1796 as security, until the obligations imposed
on the Americans by the treaty of Paris were fulfilled. Offices
were established in each of the three settlements mentioned, and
the post office undertook to send the mails forward from Kingston
as opportunities occurred of doing so with safety.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>In 1792 the first postal convention to which Canada was a
party, was concluded with the United States. Under its terms<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
the United States post office engaged to act as intermediary for
the conveyance of mails passing between Canada and Great Britain.
When a mail for Canada reached New York by the British packet,
it was taken in hand by the British packet boat agent, who after
assorting it, placed it in a sealed bag, which he delivered to the
New York post office.</p>

<p>The postmaster of New York sent this bag forward by messenger
as far as Burlington, Vermont, from whence it was taken to
Montreal by a Canadian courier, who travelled between Montreal
and Burlington every two weeks. In 1797 these trips were made
weekly.</p>

<p>For this service the Canadian post office agreed to pay the
United States department the sum which the latter would have
been entitled to collect on the same number of United States
letters passing between Burlington and New York. As the mails
were contained in a sealed bag, the United States post office had
no means of arriving at the amount due to them for this service,
and they agreed to accept the sworn statement of the British and
Canadian officials on this point.</p>

<p>The convention, also, provided for the interchange of correspondence
between Canada and the United States. According
to the practice of the period, a letter from Montreal for New
York, for instance, was chargeable with the postage due for
conveyance from Montreal to the United States boundary. This
was collected by the Canadian post office. In addition to this,
the United States post office charged the postage due to it for
the conveyance from the boundary to New York.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the collection of the postage due to
each administration were somewhat peculiar. On a letter from
Canada to the United States, the Canadian postage as far as
Burlington had to be paid at the time the letter was posted. The
United States postage was collected from the person to whom the
letter was delivered. On letters passing the other way, that is,
from the United States to Canada, another arrangement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
possible. The sender could, of course, if he chose, pay the United
States postage to Burlington, and the Canadian post office would
collect its own postage from the addressed.</p>

<p>But besides this arrangement, which was common to letters
passing in either direction, a person in the United States could
post a letter for Canada entirely unpaid, and the total amount
due would be collected on the delivery of the letter to the person
addressed in Canada. In this case, the postage due to the United
States was collected by the postmaster at Montreal, who assumed
the duties of agent, in this respect, for the United States post office.
The United States did not allow any of their postmasters to act
as agents for the collection of Canadian postage in the United
States, alleging that there were too many post offices in that
country for Burlington to look after them properly. The convention
of 1792 contained a feature which was at that time novel
in post office arrangements. It provided for the conveyance of
periodical magazines between Canada and Great Britain, charging
for its services the unusually low figure of eight cents a magazine.
The convention was signed by the deputy postmaster general of
Canada and the postmaster general of the United States.</p>

<p>Under this convention the arrangements for the exchange of
correspondence between Canada and Great Britain were very
satisfactory. During the eight months when the packet boats
called at Halifax, the mails passed by the route through the
Maritime provinces. In the winter, while the packet boats did
not visit Halifax, the mails were sent by way of New York.</p>

<p>The improvements in the roads on the route through the
United States, reduced greatly the time of conveyance between
Montreal and New York. Travellers from Montreal to New York
in 1800 noted that there was a rough road as far as Burlington,
and a rather better one to Skenesborough (Whitehall), while from
this place to New York, the journey was made by coach.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In Upper Canada, postal affairs were brought into some prominence
when that part of the country was erected into a separate
province by the constitutional act of 1791. As will be recalled,
the service beyond Kingston was conducted in rather haphazard
fashion. It was maintained largely in the interest of the little
garrisons at Niagara, Detroit and Michillimackinac.</p>

<p>The first governor of the new province, General Simcoe, was a
man of great energy, and zealous in the discharge of any duty
laid upon him. The total population in Upper Canada at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
time did not exceed ten thousand. But though these were not
neglected, it was in preparation for the thousands whom Simcoe
foresaw thronging into the province, that his attention was chiefly
occupied.</p>

<p>Before he left London for Canada, Simcoe had written to the
government several letters, some of them of great length, discussing
every conceivable topic of colonial policy. In submitting
the list of officials which he considered necessary for the government
of the province, the newly appointed governor stated that
he had in mind a proper person who would go to Canada as printer,
if he had a salary, and the governor thought that by making this
person provincial postmaster<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> as well as government printer, a
salary might be raised from the two offices, sufficient to induce him
to go.</p>

<p>When Simcoe reached Quebec in November 1791, he consulted
with Finlay on the subject, and was confirmed in his
opinion as to the desirability of a post office establishment in
Upper Canada. There was, however, a preliminary question
of great importance which it appeared to him necessary to
have settled.</p>

<p>The question was akin to that which formed the subject of a
later controversy between the home government and the colonies,
as to whether sums collected from the public as postage were to
be regarded as a tax, and as such would require the consent of
the colonies before they could be appropriated to the use of the
postmaster general in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Franklin, it will be remembered, contended that these sums
were not a tax, but simply compensation for services rendered
by the post office. The government, which founded an argument
for the legality of its course in laying taxes in America, on the
fact that the colonies had hitherto contentedly paid postage on
the letters conveyed by the post office, and made no objection
that the profits of the American post office should be sent to
England, insisted that the postage collected was a tax.</p>

<p>Simcoe had no doubt on the subject himself. He fully shared
the earlier view of the British government, and proceeded to a
further discussion of the subject. In 1778, in a belated attempt
to stay the progress of the rebellion in the colonies by a course
of conciliation, the government, by an act of parliament,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> renounced
the right it had hitherto claimed of taxing the colonies except so
far as might be necessary for the regulation of commerce; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in the case of such regulative duties, the proceeds from them
were to ensure to the benefit, not of the home government, but
of the colony from which the duties were collected.</p>

<p>Whether a post office tax was to be classed among duties for
the regulation of commerce was a point on which Simcoe could
not quite make up his mind. But if it were to be so regarded,
then by the act of 1778, which was embodied in the constitutional
act of 1791, the net produce from the Upper Canadian post office
should be appropriated to the use of the province, and the question
Simcoe asked was whether it did not lie with the general assembly
of the province, rather than with the parliament of Great Britain,
to superintend the public accounts of duties so levied and collected.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
In order that the whole matter might be placed beyond doubt,
Simcoe suggested that when a post office bill for the new province
came to be drawn up, it should contain a preamble describing its
connection with duties for the regulation of commerce, and vesting
the collection of the tax in the deputy postmaster general of
Lower Canada, who should be made accountable for the revenue
so raised, to the legislature of Upper Canada.</p>

<p>Dundas,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the home secretary, to whom the matter was submitted,
expressed no decided opinion upon it, but suggested that
bills of that nature ought not to be passed upon by the governor,
but should be reserved in order that the king's pleasure might be
signified regarding them.</p>

<p>The question of a separate establishment for Upper Canada,
as will be seen hereafter, occupied the attention both of the local
government and of the general post office in England, but though
several propositions were submitted by both sides, the objections
to it were found insuperable.</p>

<p>The only other event of importance occurring in Upper Canada
at this period which affected the history of the post office was
the founding of the city of Toronto. Until 1794, when the lines
of the present city were laid out under the direction of governor
Simcoe, and for some years later, the future capital of Ontario<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
was in a state of the most complete isolation.</p>

<p>On the way up lake Ontario, settlement reached no further
than the western end of the bay of Quinte. An official sent from
York, as Toronto was named in 1792, to Kingston, to meet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
accompany immigrants to York, found very few desirous of going
so great a distance from all settlements.</p>

<p>The country to the west of Toronto was equally unsettled.
The line of farm holdings from Niagara westward, came to an
end at the head of the lake about the site of the present city of
Hamilton. From that point to York, the country was occupied
by the Mississauga Indians. When it was determined to remove
the seat of government to York in 1797, the chief justice complained
that the lack of accommodation of any kind was so great
that the larger part of those whom business or duty called to
York must remain during their stay there, either in the open
air, or crowded together in huts or tents, in a manner equally
offensive to their feelings and injurious to their health.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The exact date on which the post office was established at
York, and the name of the first postmaster are unfortunately not
disclosed by the records, which are far from complete. There is
a probability, however, which amounts to practical certainty, that
the post office was opened in either 1799 or 1800, and that the
first postmaster was William Willcocks.</p>

<p>Lieutenant governor Hunter states that in 1799, excepting
the single trip made annually from Montreal to Niagara, there was
no service beyond Kingston, the mails for the posts west of that
point being taken by the king's vessels, and their distribution
effected by the commandants at the posts.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>In 1800, there was certainly a regular postmaster at York,
as the legislative council in that year directed the surveyor
general to give Wilcox, the postmaster, such information as would
enable Finlay to answer certain questions asked by the governor
general respecting the establishment of regular couriers between
Quebec and York.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Besides the inhabitants of the rapidly growing town of York,
the post office at that place served to accommodate for many
years the German settlement in Markham township, which was
begun in 1797 under the leadership of Berczy, an enterprising
promoter.</p>

<p>In October 1799, Finlay's connection with the post office in
Canada ceased, and it is unpleasant to add that he was dismissed
as a defaulter. He admitted an indebtedness to the postmaster
general, amounting to £1408.</p>

<p>To the lieutenant governor Finlay explained<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> that a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
part of the debt arose in 1794 from the disallowance for a number
of years past, of certain items of credit, which had been accepted
and passed at the general post office. The death in bankruptcy
of the postmaster at Three Rivers increased considerably the
amount of Finlay's obligations to the postmaster general.</p>

<p>Finlay pointed out, with truth, that he had not only successfully
maintained the post office in Canada under very trying
circumstances, but that through the relations he had established
with the <i>maîtres de poste</i>, he had saved to the postmaster general
not less than £12,000. He pleaded, therefore, that as large an
allowance as possible be made, on account of these considerations,
and that he might be given time to pay any balance which might
thereafter be found due.</p>

<p>Finlay's plea was strongly supported by the leading merchants
in the colony, and by the lieutenant governor, who represented
that he was the oldest servant of the crown in Canada, being
senior executive and legislative councillor. When the land committee
was formed he was made chairman, and on him fell practically
all the onerous duties devolving on the committee during
that period. He was seventy years of age, forty of which had
been spent in the service of the colony, and was suffering from
an incurable disease, from which he died not long after his dismissal.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these pleas, judgment was obtained for the
amount of the debt, and some land which had been granted to him
in Stanstead county as a special recognition of his services, was
attached by the orders of the postmaster general. Either the
claim was not pressed rigorously, or the land did not suffice to
cover the debt, for after standing on the departmental books as
uncollectable for many years, Finlay's debt was finally wiped
off in 1830.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Administration of George Heriot&mdash;Extension of postal service in Upper Canada&mdash;Irritating
restrictions imposed by general post office&mdash;Disputes with
the administrator of the colony.</p></div>


<p>George Heriot, who succeeded Finlay, had been a clerk in the
board of ordinance for many years before his appointment as
deputy postmaster general. He was a man of some literary
ability, his history of Canada which was published in 1801 being
a high-priced item in catalogues of Americana. Of Heriot's zeal
and intelligence the general post office had no reason to complain,
but he had a sensitive self-esteem, which was a most unfortunate
possession as matters then stood.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, personal characteristics such as these would call
for no mention, but the relations between the post office and the
provincial authorities at this time were so difficult that the utmost
tact on the part of the deputy postmaster general would scarcely
gain more than a tolerable success. The position of the deputy
postmaster general towards the governor and the legislatures was
peculiar.</p>

<p>As an official of the general post office in London, he was
subject to the orders of the postmaster general and to no other
authority whatever. Neither the governors nor the legislatures
had the least right to give him instructions. Although the postal
service was indispensable to the conduct of the official and commercial
transactions of the colony, and its maintenance in a state
of efficiency a matter of first importance to the colony, the power
of the colonial authorities went no further than the submission
of their views and desires to the postmaster general or to his
deputy in Canada.</p>

<p>To a community jealous of its rights of self-government, the
situation was irritating enough, but the natural annoyance might
have been largely relieved by an appreciative regard, on the
part of the post office, for the wants of the rapidly increasing settlements.
This, however, was the last trait the post office was likely
to show at this period.</p>

<p>The post office was subordinate to the treasury, a relationship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it never permitted itself to disregard. The deputy postmaster
general was under strict injunctions not to enter upon any scheme
for the extension or improvement of the postal service, unless he
was fully satisfied that the resulting expense would be covered
by the augmented revenue. Each application for improvement
in the service was dealt with from this standpoint.</p>

<p>The fact that the service in any part of the country was very
profitable to the post office was held to be no justification for
applying any portion of the profits to make up the deficiencies of
revenue in districts less favourably situated. On one occasion,
where the needs in some new districts in course of settlement
appeared to Heriot to demand special consideration, he directed
that for a time the whole of the surplus revenue from Upper
Canada should be applied to extensions and improvements. When
his action was reported to the postmaster general, it was promptly
disavowed, and he was compelled to cancel the arrangements he
had made.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>A policy of this kind was ill-adapted to colonies, which were
steadily expanding by the implanting of small, widely-separated
communities, and the man on whom devolved the duty of carrying
on a postal service under these conditions had no easy task. Finlay
had certain advantages as a member of the legislative council
which Heriot did not enjoy, and moreover his difficulties were not
so great.</p>

<p>It was only after Finlay had ceased to be deputy postmaster
general that the settlements in Upper Canada began to insist on
a regular postal service; and in cases where demands were made
upon him which his instructions forbade him to grant, he could
always depend on the good will of his associates in the council to
relieve him from unreasonable pressure. As superintendent of
post houses, his influence with the <i>maîtres de poste</i> enabled him
to keep the cost of their services on the main routes at a low
figure.</p>

<p>Although Finlay's connection with the post office was terminated
under disagreeable circumstances, no attempt was made
to deprive him of his provincial appointments, which he held
until his death at the end of 1801. Heriot then lost no time in
applying to be appointed to the vacancy in the legislative council,
and to the superintendency of post houses. He was successful
in neither case.</p>

<p>Heriot was uniformly unfortunate in his relations with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
governors of the colony. His self-assertiveness irritated those
who were accustomed to look for nothing but deference from the
persons about them. Heriot seems to have accepted the decision
as respects the council as final. But he made a strong effort to
force the hand of lieutenant governor Milnes with regard to the
post houses. He appealed to the postmaster general in England,
who made representations to the colonial office in the matter.</p>

<p>The post office had already begun to feel the inconvenience
of separating the control of the <i>maîtres de poste</i> from the office
of the deputy postmaster general, as these officials declined to
continue to carry the mail couriers on terms more favourable than
those granted to the ordinary travelling public.</p>

<p>The colonial office was inclined to the post office view on the
subject, but the lieutenant governor was firm in maintaining the
position he had taken. The <i>maîtres de poste</i>, he stated, were
habitants who possessed, each of them, a small property which
rendered them quite independent. Their service, which was to
carry passengers on the king's road, was an onerous one, and the
advances in the price of the articles of life, coupled with the fact
that their exclusive privilege was systematically disregarded,
made them reluctant to take the appointments.</p>

<p>Men of this kind, Milnes declared, required management as
they would not submit to coercion. Finlay through his personal
influence with the <i>maîtres de poste</i> had managed to obtain the
conveyance of the mails at sixpence a league, which was only half
the charge made to the public for the same service. For some
time before his death, Finlay had difficulty in inducing the <i>maîtres
de poste</i> to continue this favourable arrangement, and on his
death they refused to work under it any longer.</p>

<p>The <i>maîtres de poste</i> had the full sympathy of the lieutenant
governor who saw no reason for the discrimination in favour of
the post office. Although he endeavoured to obtain a favourable
arrangement for the mail couriers, he considered it would be most
impolitic on the part of the post office to insist on continuing to
occupy their position of advantage.</p>

<p>But valuable as the post house system was in the early period
of the country's growth, it soon had to yield to a higher class of
travelling facility. As travel in the colony increased the two-wheeled
<i>calèches</i> drawn by a single horse and barely holding
two persons would no longer do. The changes at the post houses,
every hour or little more, with the long delays while the horses
were secured and harnessed, were very wearisome. Before Heriot's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
term expired, stage coaches had been placed on the principal
roads.</p>

<p>In leaving the old system and its ways, it will be interesting
to record the impressions of Hugh Gray, an English gentleman,
who travelled from Quebec to Montreal in 1806.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The mode of
travel, he said, would not bear comparison with that in England,
and the inns were very far from clean, but he found many things
to lighten the hardships of travel in Canada. If, leaving England
aside, he compared the accommodations in Canada with those
in Spain, Portugal, or even in parts of France, he found the balance
in favour of Canada.</p>

<p>The politeness and consideration Gray received at the inns in
Canada offset many inconveniences. Often on the continent,
after a day of fatiguing travel, sometimes wet and hungry, he was
obliged to carry his own luggage into the inn at which he had arrived
and see, himself, that it was put in a place of safety. But in
Canada he was charmed with the politeness and urbanity with
which he was welcomed at every inn: "Voulez-vous bien, Monsieur,
avoir la complaisance d'entrer; voilà une chaise, Monsieur, asseyez
vous, s'il vous plait."</p>

<p>"If they had the thing you wanted," continued Gray, "it
was given to you with a good grace; if they had not they would
tell you so in such a tone and manner as to show they were sorry
for it." "Je n'en ai point. J'en suis mortifié." "You saw it was
their poverty that refused you, not their will. Then if there
was no inn to be had, you were never at a loss for shelter. There
was not a farmer, shopkeeper, nay, nor even a <i>seigneur</i> or country
gentleman who, on being civilly applied to for accommodation,
would not give you the best in the house and every accommodation
in his power."</p>

<p>The determination of the lieutenant governor to hold Heriot
at arm's length, and allow him no part in the local government
was unfortunate, as it prevented the mutual understanding between
the colonial authorities and the post office which must have been
beneficial to both. Heriot made several later efforts to secure
the control of the <i>maîtres de poste</i>, but always without success.</p>

<p>The principal feature of Heriot's administration was the
establishment of a regular mail service to the settlements in Upper
Canada. The single opportunity for the exchange of correspondence
afforded by the post office authorities during the many
months when navigation was closed was absurdly inadequate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the needs of the rapidly increasing province. The courier set out
from Montreal in January of each year, travelling on foot or
snow-shoes with his mail bag slung over his shoulder. He did
very well when he covered eighteen miles a day. The journey to
Niagara, with the return to Montreal, was not accomplished until
spring was approaching, three months later.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, General Hunter,
was anxious to improve the communication in that province,
and opened correspondence with Heriot on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Heriot
laid the lieutenant governor's proposition before the postmaster
general with his warm commendation. He pointed out that the
rapid increase in the population, the salubrity of the climate, and
the fertility of the soil, all encouraged the belief that Upper Canada
would soon become one of the first of the British settlements in
North America.</p>

<p>General Hunter, Heriot also reminded the postmaster general,
had in course of construction a road from the bay of Quinte to
York, which in a few months would allow of easy travel by any
of the common conveyances of the country. More, his excellency
when informed of the views held by the post office on proposals
involving expenditure, readily undertook that the province should
make up any deficiency arising from the carrying of his schemes
into execution.</p>

<p>This was the first considerable proposition submitted by
Heriot since his appointment, and the postmaster general made
it the occasion of an admonition as to the considerations Heriot
should have in mind in dealing with a proposition of that kind.
He sent extracts of letters addressed to Finlay on the question of
establishing new posts, pointing out that they served to show
that unless any new proposition had for its object both the public
convenience and the interests of the revenue, it was not to be
encouraged.</p>

<p>The system of posts, the postmaster general went on to say,
might be made, comparatively speaking, as perfect in Canada as
in Great Britain, but the question was, would the board as a
board of revenue be justified in so doing when the amount of the
revenue was so trifling. However, he directed Heriot to report
fully on the several aspects of the lieutenant governor's proposition,
not overlooking the general's offer of indemnification in the event
of the postage not amounting to sufficient to defray the expense.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor having repeated his assurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
any insufficiency in the revenue to meet the additional expense
would be made up from the provincial treasury, Heriot set about
improving the service&mdash;but cautiously. At that time he contented
himself with providing monthly instead of yearly trips to
Upper Canada during the winter. In summer he continued to
depend on the occasional trips of the <i>bateaux</i> on the river and
the king's ships on the lake.</p>

<p>In order to assist Heriot, who had some difficulty in procuring
the services of suitable couriers for the winter trips, the lieutenant
governor directed the commandants at Kingston and York to
place trusty soldiers at the disposal of the post office.</p>

<p>There were few letters carried during this period except for the
public departments, and they found it less expensive to employ
a messenger of their own to visit the several posts and take the
bulky accounts and vouchers which constituted the greater part
of their correspondence, than to utilize the services of the post
office. When it was pointed out to the lieutenant governor that
by his failure to employ the post office, he was setting a bad
example to the inhabitants who used every means to evade the
postmaster general's monopoly, the lieutenant governor agreed
to have the correspondence from the outposts carried by the mail
couriers.</p>

<p>The territory served by the regular post office did not extend
beyond Niagara. But at Amherstburg, the western end of lake
Erie, and over two hundred miles beyond Niagara, there were a
military post and the beginnings of a settlement, which it was
desirable to provide with the means of communication.</p>

<p>During his visit to Niagara in 1801, Heriot devised a plan<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
for this purpose, which appears to have contained all the advantages
of a regular postal service, with the charges so much less than the
ordinary postage rates as to give the people of the district cause
to regret the advent of the regular postmaster and mail courier.</p>

<p>Heriot proposed that the postmaster of Amherstburg should
receive letters for despatch, and, from time to time as one of the
vessels on the lake happened to be going to fort Erie, at the
eastern end of the lake, make up a bag, seal it with the official
seal, and deliver it to the captain of the vessel.</p>

<p>At fort Erie the bag was to be placed on one of the flat-bottomed
<i>bateaux</i>, which traded between that village and Chippewa and
the Niagara river. Between Chippewa, Queenstown and Niagara,
on the Niagara portage, there were stage coaches running, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the bag was taken to Niagara by this means. If the letters were
intended for places beyond Niagara, they were put into the regular
post office at that point.</p>

<p>This arrangement was quite as safe and expeditious as the
postal service between Niagara and Kingston, and yet the charges
were very much less than if the letters had been carried the same
distance within the authorized system. The ordinary postage on a
letter from Amherstburg to fort Erie by land would be tenpence.
Heriot did not consider that he could properly charge more than
twopence a letter. From fort Erie to Niagara the postage would
have been fourpence, which was the rate Heriot proposed to
charge.</p>

<p>The question will arise, in what regard this scheme differed
from the ordinary postal arrangements, the charges for which
were fixed by statute. The point of difference lay simply in this,
that Heriot did not propose to administer the oath of office to
the courier, who effected the transportation of the mails from
Amherstburg to Niagara. There would be none but trustworthy
men employed to look after the mails, and the couriers were under
effective supervision in the fact that the postmaster in making
up the mail enclosed with it a certificate as to the number of
letters in it, which the receiving postmaster verified before the
courier was paid for his services.</p>

<p>Heriot's scheme, then, was identical with the ordinary arrangements
in all respects but one, and that one was purely formal.
Heriot's scruples would lead one to suspect a desire to show how
excessive the ordinary charges were.</p>

<p>There was no change in the arrangements for the postal service
in Upper Canada until 1810, though before that date there had
been some agitation for improvements. In 1808, the legislative
assembly requested that a regular service be established through
the year, instead of monthly trips during the winter merely.</p>

<p>Further representations were made on the insufficiency of the
existing service, and in 1810 Heriot provided fortnightly trips
throughout the year between Montreal and Kingston, but owing
to the badness of the road beyond Kingston, he was unable to
give a regular service to York except in the winter. During
this period, however, the trips between Kingston and York were
made fortnightly.</p>

<p>Efficient roadmaking throughout Canada was attended with
many difficulties, owing to the great stretches of land which were
in the hands either of the crown or held as clergy reserves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
which were held by speculators. These absentee holders were
not bound by the obligation which lay on the residents to make
and maintain good roads through their property, and consequently,
even where roads were made by the government through the
province, they soon fell into disrepair in those districts, where there
were no resident owners to keep them up.</p>

<p>General Hunter in 1800 and 1801 had a road made from Kingston
to York, and then on to Ancaster, near Hamilton, where it connected
with the road to Niagara, but at their best such roads
were little more than bridle paths through the woods. In the
autumn of 1811 Heriot yielded another step and placed couriers
fortnightly on the road from Kingston to Niagara by way of York.
He also arranged for a courier to go to Amherstburg or Sandwich
as often as commercial requirements demanded it.</p>

<p>Heriot at this time took a step which drew upon him the
sharp attention of the home authorities. He directed the postmaster
at York to hold the surplus revenue from the western
part of the province instead of sending it to Quebec for transmission
to England, and to apply it to improving the arrangements
in that section of the province.</p>

<p>The secretary of the general post office expressed a doubt as
to whether the whole of the revenue should have been applied
towards improving the service, and intimated that approval of
his action should be held for the postmaster general. Shortly
after, Heriot was informed that his action had not been approved,
and that it would be necessary to cancel his instructions to the
postmaster of York.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>This incident fairly illustrates how far Heriot's hands were
tied by orders from home, and how little he deserved the censures
so freely meted out to him for his unwillingness to provide the
country with a system of communication adequate to its requirements.
In yielding to any extent to the reasonable demands of
the provincial authorities, he was courting disapproval and even
reprimand from his superiors.</p>

<p>But in spite of the determination of the postmaster general
that no expenditure should be made for postal service, which did
not promise an immediate return equal to or greater than the
outlay, the country was growing too rapidly to permit of any great
delay in providing increased facilities for correspondence. While
the post office held on to the monopoly in letter carrying, it had
to make some sort of provision for doing the work itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1815, when peace had been concluded with the United
States, Sir Gordon Drummond, the commander of the forces, and
administrator of Canada, directed Heriot to arrange for two trips
a week between Montreal and Kingston, Heriot invited tenders
for this service, and was dismayed to find that the lowest offer
was for £3276, an amount double the anticipated revenues.</p>

<p>With his instructions from the postmaster general before him,
an outlay of that magnitude was not to be thought of, but Heriot
did go the length of authorizing weekly trips over the whole route
between Montreal and Niagara and arranged for fortnightly
trips to Amherstburg from Dundas, a village on the grand route
between York and Niagara.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The mails were carried between
Montreal and Kingston by coach; between Kingston and Niagara
on horseback or by sleigh; and between Dundas and the settlements
at the western end of lake Erie on foot.</p>

<p>In reporting these arrangements to the postmaster general,
Heriot explained that, with the close of the war, military expresses
had been discontinued, and it became necessary to provide additional
accommodation to the commissariat and other military
departments, but the increased postage more than covered the
expense incurred.</p>

<p>In March 1816 the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada
pressed for further improvements in order to facilitate communication
between the several courts of justice and every part of the
province, so that notices might be sent to jurors and others having
business with the courts.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In concluding his letter to the general
post office recommending the application of the lieutenant governor,
Heriot added that there was a strong desire on the part of influential
people in Upper Canada that there should be a deputy postmaster
general for that province, as well as one for Lower Canada.</p>

<p>Heriot favoured the idea and recommended William Allan,
postmaster of York for the position. The postmaster general,
however, disapproved of the proposal of an independent deputy
for Upper Canada. He agreed with Heriot that there would be
advantages in having an official residing in Upper Canada with
a wider authority than that ordinarily exercised by a mere postmaster,
but thought that the postmaster of York might without
change of title be made to answer all the requirements of an
assistant to the deputy postmaster general.</p>

<p>Before leaving the service in Upper Canada, an incident should
be mentioned, showing the difficulties military men stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
far from a post office had in corresponding with Great Britain.
At the end of the campaign of 1813 in the Niagara peninsula,
the officers of the right division, which was quartered at Stoney
Creek, presented a memorial to the governor general laying before
him their hard case, and praying for relief.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> They desired to
write to their friends and relatives at home, but could not do so,
owing to the post office regulation which required that all letters
sent to Great Britain should have the postage paid on them as
far as Halifax.</p>

<p>The sea postage did not require to be paid, as that could be
collected from the person receiving the letter, but unless the
letter was fully paid to Halifax, it was detained and returned to
the writer. As the nearest post office in operation was York,
nearly fifty miles away, and as they had no acquaintance there or
at Montreal or Quebec, who might pay the postage for them,
they were without the means of relieving the anxiety of their
parents, wives and others who could not learn whether they
were alive or not. They asked that a bag be made up monthly,
as Lord Wellington did from Portugal, and sent free of expense
to the Horseguards in London, from which place the letters might
be carried to the post office for delivery.</p>

<p>The postal service in Lower Canada and eastward underwent
no change from the time of Heriot's accession to office until the
war of 1812. As in 1800, the couriers between Montreal and
Quebec still left each place on Monday and Thursday mornings,
and meeting at Three Rivers, exchanged their mails, and returned,
reaching their points of departure two days later. The mails
between Quebec and Fredericton continued to be exchanged
fortnightly in summer, and monthly in winter, and between
Fredericton and St. John, and St. John and Halifax, there were
weekly exchanges as in Finlay's time.</p>

<p>Lower Canada still found its principal outlet to Great Britain
in the weekly mail carried between Montreal and one of the towns
of the United States near the Canadian boundary. In 1810, the
place of exchange of mails between Lower Canada and Boston
and New York was Swanton, a small town in Vermont.</p>

<p>But, though the service arrangements remained unchanged,
they by no means escaped criticism. In 1810, Sir James Craig,
the governor general, complained of the slowness of the communication
with the United States and with the Maritime provinces.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Letters from New York seldom reached Quebec in less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
than fifteen or sixteen days, and it usually took a month for the
courier to travel from Halifax to Quebec.</p>

<p>For the course of the post from New York, the governor was
not disposed to blame Heriot entirely, as he knew the connections
from New York to Swanton to be faulty, but he thought that,
by a little exertion, Heriot could do much to remedy the defects.
As for the movement of the couriers between Quebec and Halifax,
the governor had been informed by certain London merchants
that the journey could be made in six days. He would not insist
on a speed equal to that, but sixteen or seventeen days ought to
be easily within the capacity of the couriers.</p>

<p>Dealing with the Quebec-Halifax complaint first, Heriot was
aware that the journey from Halifax to Quebec had been made in
six days, but as the distance was six hundred and thirty-three
miles, three hundred and sixty-eight of which could not be travelled
by horse and carriage, he regarded the trip as an extraordinary
performance. The circumstances, however, were unusually favourable.
The weather was at its best, and no expense was spared
to make the journey as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>But it was useless, Heriot insisted, to compare speed of that
kind with that which was within the power of a courier who had to
carry a load sometimes weighing two hundred pounds on his back,
for a distance of forty miles, after having rowed and poled up
rivers and across lakes for two hundred miles. If the contractor
was able to disregard considerations of expense, and employ as
many couriers as could be done with advantage, much time
might doubtless be saved.</p>

<p>Heriot was sure there were no grounds for believing that there
would be any material increase in the revenue as the result of such
expenditure. The commerce between the Canadas and the Maritime
provinces was so trifling that it was all carried on by three
or four small coasting vessels. Indeed, were it not for the correspondence
between the military establishments, it would be better
to drop regular trips between Quebec and Halifax, as the British
mails could be carried much more cheaply and with greater celerity
by expresses.</p>

<p>The connection with New York offered matter for criticism,
but Heriot could not be reproached for remissness in this regard.
He had proposed to the authorities at Washington that his couriers
should carry the mails all the way between Montreal and New
York, offering to pay the United States just as if their couriers
had done the service within their territory, but the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
department would not entertain the proposition. He had also
endeavoured, without success, to have the British mails landed
at Boston during the winter months, instead of at New York.
If this could have been accomplished, there would have been a
considerable saving in the time required for the delivery of the
British mails at Montreal and Quebec.</p>

<p>The war of 1812 had noticeable effects on the postal service.
The mails passing between Quebec and Halifax had to be safeguarded
against attack on the part of hostile parties from across
the border and against privateers, who infested the lower waters
of the St. John river and the bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>From the time the courier on his way eastward left the shores
of the St. Lawrence, he was in danger of surprise. The portage
between the St. Lawrence and lake Temiscouata was wild and
uninhabited, and it would have been an easy matter for the enemy
to waylay the courier if he travelled unprotected. When he
reached the St. John river his course lay along the United States
border. Indeed a considerable part of his route lay in territory
which was afterwards adjudged by the Ashburton treaty to belong
to the United States.</p>

<p>Heriot facilitated the couriers' journey over the portage by
placing twenty-two old soldiers with their families at intervals
on the route. They were supplied with arms, ammunition and
rations, as the country was so mountainous, sterile and inhospitable,
that no man could derive a subsistence from the soil. The couriers
on entering the portage were, also, accompanied by an escort of
two soldiers, who travelled with them as far as the Madawaska
settlement. From that point downwards, the local captains of
militia had orders to render all needful assistance and protection
to the couriers.</p>

<p>At Fredericton an entire change was made in the route. The
route had till then followed the course of the St. John river to the
city of St. John, from which place the couriers were taken across
the bay of Fundy to Annapolis, in a small sloop. In order to
avoid the chances of capture on the water stretches or in the bay,
the couriers were sent across the country through the centre of
the province to Cumberland, as Amherst was then called, and
thence on to Halifax.</p>

<p>This arrangement left St. John unprovided with connection
with either Quebec or Halifax, but it was brought into the scheme
by a separate courier who met the couriers on the main route at
Sussexvale. The travel on the new route was at first very bad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
but the lieutenant governors of the two Maritime provinces, who
were interested in the success of the scheme, promised to do their
best to induce their assemblies to put the roads in good condition.</p>

<p>In changing the route from Fredericton to Halifax, and requiring
the couriers to travel inland, instead of along the waterways,
the deputy postmaster general was taking a measure in the direction
of safety, but those who had a particular interest in the transmission
of their correspondence intact could not look without
concern at the exposure of the mails on the long stretch between
the foot of lake Temiscouata and Fredericton.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia and the admiral of
the Halifax station were both uneasy at the possibility of their
despatches being intercepted by the Americans, and grasped eagerly
at a suggestion thrown out that the courier from Halifax should
not go to Fredericton at all, but on leaving Amherst should pursue
a north-westerly course till he reached the Matapedia river at the
western end of the bay of Chaleurs. From this point, the route
would lie across the bottom of the Gaspe peninsula to the St.
Lawrence near Metis.</p>

<p>The suggested route encountered the strong opposition of
Heriot.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> "The heights of the interior," he declared, "are more
elevated than those towards the sea, and some of them with snow
on their summits which remain undissolved from one year to the
other. The land between the mountains is probably intersected
by rugged defiles, by swamps and by deep and impracticable gullies.
A region so inhospitable and desolate as from its interior aspect,
and its latitude as this may without exaggeration be conceived to
be, can scarcely be visited by savages. Suppose a road were cut
through this rugged desert, it would not be possible to find any
person who would settle there, and no courier could proceed on
foot for a journey of some hundred miles, through a difficult and
dreary waste alike destitute of shelter and of the prospect of
assistance."</p>

<p>Heriot's conviction was that the present route was the only
possible one, and if the enemy threatened to cut off communications,
it might be necessary to establish two additional military
posts, one at the head of the Madawaska settlement, the other
between Grand Falls and Presqu' Isle.</p>

<p>A blockhouse at each point, with a non-commissioned officer,
a few privates and two savages attached, would in Heriot's opinion
afford sufficient protection. The enemy would scarcely incur the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
trouble and expense of marching one or two hundred men from
an immense distance to take or destroy these forts with the precarious
and doubtful prospect of interrupting a courier, to whom
the nature of the country presented a variety of means of eluding
their utmost vigilance.</p>

<p>The idea of establishing a route between Nova Scotia and the
St. Lawrence, which would follow the northern shore of New
Brunswick, was not carried into effect at once, but as will be seen
it occupied attention from time to time and was eventually realized.</p>

<p>The war affected the postal service in Lower Canada to the
extent of causing the conveyance of the mails between Montreal
and Quebec to be increased from twice a week to daily.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Sir
George Prevost having pointed out to Heriot the necessity for more
frequent communication on account of the war, the latter expressed
his willingness to increase the trips, but stipulated that the men
employed in the service should not be subject to enlistment as
it was very difficult to secure trustworthy men.</p>

<p>The governor agreed, and directed the colonels of militia that
they were to impose no military duties on post office employees.
On the conclusion of the war, the couriers' trips were reduced
from six to five weekly, at which frequency they remained for
many years.</p>

<p>The last year of Heriot's administration was marked by a
disagreeable quarrel with Sir Gordon Drummond,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> who was
administrator of Canada on Prevost's retirement. In the beginning
of 1815, the legislature of Upper Canada adopted an address
pointing out that the postal arrangements were very defective,
and expressing the opinion that the revenue from Upper Canada
was ample to meet the additional expense necessary to put the
service on a satisfactory footing. If an efficient service were
provided, and it turned out that they were wrong in their anticipation
of increased revenues, they were prepared to pay higher
rates of postage.</p>

<p>Herein lay a difficulty for the postmaster general. The postal
charges in Canada were the same as those in Great Britain, and
were collected by the authority of the same act of parliament.
The postmaster general was not free from doubts as to the legality
of the proceedings of the post office in taking postage in Canada,
and he did not wish to raise the question by the enactment of a
special act for Canada. He intimated to Heriot his disinclination
to bring the question into prominence in Canada, and asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Heriot to give his mind to the proposition for an improvement
in the service.</p>

<p>About the time the letter from the postmaster general containing
this instruction reached Heriot, Drummond himself wrote
to Heriot, drawing attention to the shortcomings in the service,
expressing his conviction that the necessary improvements would
lead to enhanced revenues, and concluding with an intimation
that unless he were provided with adequate facilities for communicating
with that part of his command which was in Upper
Canada, he would be obliged to restore military expresses.</p>

<p>Sir Gordon Drummond's services to Canada during the war
were such as to entitle him to an honourable place in the memory
of Canadians, but he did not appear at his best in his controversy
with Heriot. He exhibited too much of that arbitrariness and
impatience with other people's views which is commonly observed
among military chiefs.</p>

<p>Heriot replied promptly to the governor's letter, stating that
he had invited tenders for a semi-weekly service between Montreal
and Kingston, and that the offers he received were quite beyond
any possible revenue to be derived from the service. He had,
however, accelerated the existing service by having the couriers
travel on horseback, the horses being changed at convenient
distances along the route.</p>

<p>As regards the service beyond York, Heriot directed the postmaster
of York to arrange for a regular weekly courier to Niagara,
and to set about securing a postmaster at Amherstburg to replace
the former incumbent, who had resigned. Heriot wound up his
letter by stating that he would have been particularly gratified
if he had the power to meet his excellency's wishes in every point,
but expressed his regret that his instructions obliged him to act
on principles of economy.</p>

<p>The letter was courteously expressed, and showed an evident
desire to go as far as his instructions would allow, in meeting the
governor's wishes. But Drummond was not satisfied. His wrath
rose at the appearance of opposition. In repeating his views that
increased revenue would follow upon improvements in the service,
he declared that the existing arrangements were slovenly and
uncertain, and, in the opinion of merchants, insecure. Moreover,
he did not believe that Heriot's instructions were intended to be
injurious to the interests of Upper Canada.</p>

<p>Drummond then most unreasonably found fault with Heriot
for leaving to Allan the duty of attending to the requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of Niagara and Amherstburg, when his excellency had ordered
Heriot to give the matter his personal attention. Heriot's time
was very fully occupied at Quebec with the ordinary duties of his
office, a fact of which Drummond could not have been ignorant;
and to order him to leave these duties, and make a journey to the
western end of the province, involving a travel of scarcely less
than twelve hundred miles, to do a piece of work which any
subordinate in the district could do equally well, argued either
an indifference as regards the daily calls upon Heriot's time, or a
determination to annoy him, either of which was discreditable to
the governor general.</p>

<p>Heriot was steadily respectful, however, but maintained that
with the powers entrusted to him it was impossible to meet Drummond's
views. He cited the incident of 1812, when his recommendation
that the whole of the revenue from Upper Canada
should be expended on extensions and improvements had been
disapproved, and the arrangements founded upon these suggestions
had to be cancelled. As for his employment of Allan to secure a
postmaster at Amherstburg, Allan knew the district while he
himself did not, and in his circumstances he was compelled to
rely upon his officials as he did in the west and at Halifax.</p>

<p>The whole of the case was laid by Heriot before the postmaster
general. His situation, he declared, was very disagreeable, as
people seemed to imagine that he had carte blanche as to the disposal
of the post office revenue. Every governor on coming to
Canada assailed Heriot with his particular scheme for improvement.
Prevost, who had come from the governorship of Nova Scotia,
insisted on a large expenditure on the service in that province.
Drummond, whose interests lay in Upper Canada, was peremptory
in regard to the claims of that part of the country. The consequence
of all this was correspondence always lengthy and frequently
unpleasant.</p>

<p>What Heriot desired to know was whether his conduct was
approved or condemned by his superiors. The official silence left
him in uncertainty and suspense. Heriot concluded by asking
to be relieved of the office and to be allowed some remuneration
for past services.</p>

<p>After a short lull, trouble broke out afresh, and this time
Drummond managed to put Heriot clearly in the wrong. A very
sharp letter from the governor drew from Heriot the reply that
the deputy postmaster general in Canada was governed by several
acts of parliament, and by instructions from the general post office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and he was not subject to any orders, but through the secretary
of the post office. He would, however, afford every necessary
information when applied to in the mode of solicitation or
request.</p>

<p>This was not the tone to take in addressing the chief executive
in the colony; and the governor promptly laid the whole matter
before the colonial secretary, condemning Heriot for his incapacity,
insubordination and insolence, and declaring that nothing but
the fear of embarrassing the accounts prevented him from instantly
suspending Heriot. He urged his dismissal.</p>

<p>A fortnight later Drummond reported further grievances.
Indeed, Heriot seems now to have cast prudence as well as respect
for the governor's office to the winds. The governor had demanded
to see the postmaster general's instructions to Heriot, and it was
not until the demand had been twice repeated that Heriot saw
fit to obey.</p>

<p>Among those instructions was one directing the deputy postmaster
general to keep the orders of the postmaster general and
the table of rates in his office, for his own guidance, and for the
satisfaction of all persons desiring to see them. This Drummond
insisted on reading as a direction to the deputy postmaster general
to make all his communications from the postmaster general
public, and he dilates on the disrespect of Heriot in withholding
from the governor what he is under orders to disclose to the first
comer.</p>

<p>All this is, of course, manifestly disingenuous, and does not
impose on Heriot's superiors in the general post office. The
secretary of the general post office in discussing Drummond's
complaints, has words of commendation for Heriot's zeal and
alacrity. He always considered Heriot a judicious, active and
efficient officer. Governors, he affirmed, too commonly entertain
the idea that the whole revenue of the post office should be devoted
to extending the communications. Whatever view might be held
as to the principle, Heriot at all events was precluded by his
instructions from acting upon it without the express authority
of the postmaster general.</p>

<p>While Heriot had, beyond question, given ample grounds for
irritation on Drummond's part, it should be remembered, in
dealing with the demand for Heriot's dismissal, Drummond was
told that he had been sixteen years in the service, and had on
many occasions received the thanks of the board. It might be
sufficient to enjoin upon Heriot a more respectful attitude towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the governor, and consult with him as to the extension of communications,
and the interests of the revenue.</p>

<p>The postmaster general concurred in the secretary's views.
But the quarrel was now past mending, and when after repeated
requests to be relieved, Heriot declared that no motive of interest
or advantage could induce him to stay in the service longer than
was necessary to appoint his successor, the postmaster general
decided to accept his resignation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Administration of Daniel Sutherland&mdash;Postal service on the Ottawa river,
and to eastern townships&mdash;Ocean mails.</p></div>


<p>On Heriot's retirement, a number of London merchants who
traded to Canada, recommended that the postmaster of Montreal,
Daniel Sutherland, be appointed as his successor, and the appointment
was made in April 1816.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Sutherland entered upon his
duties with full knowledge of the postal service in Canada, as he
had been postmaster of Montreal since 1807.</p>

<p>An effort was made at this time to remove the headquarters
of the department from Quebec to Montreal, but it was not encouraged.
The postmaster general was of opinion that, although
there were no direct official relations between the governor general
and the head of the postal service, it would be inadvisable to
diminish in any way the opportunities that then existed of enlisting
the good will of the governor towards the post office by the pursuit
of a more tactful course than had been taken by Sutherland's
predecessor. If, while relations between the chief executive and
the deputy postmaster general were thus strained, the office of
the latter had been removed to Montreal, the chances of establishing
a more cordial feeling on the part of the governor towards the post
office would have greatly lessened.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the postmaster general in this matter was soon
shown. It was not long before the post office incurred the hostility
of the legislatures in both Upper and Lower Canada and its case
would have been hard indeed, if it had not obtained the steady
support of the governors and the executive councils in the two
provinces.</p>

<p>A notable feature of Sutherland's administration was the
extension of the service into settlements, which lay far off the
beaten lines. The first of these to be provided with a post office
was the settlement of Perth. In the summer of 1815, a number
of Scotch artisans and peasants sailed from Greenock, attracted
by the inducements held out to settlers in British North America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and of these about sixty families spent the winter in Brockville
on the St. Lawrence. When spring opened, they proceeded inland
till they reached the Rideau river, and took up homes about the
site of the present town of Perth.</p>

<p>The new settlement was almost immediately joined by a large
number of disbanded troops, who were set free on the conclusion
of peace with the United States. By October 1816, there were
over sixteen hundred settlers in the district. They were fortunate
in securing the interest of Sir John Sherbrooke, the governor
general, at whose instance a post office was opened, and fortnightly
trips were made with the mails from Brockville.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>A road was broken between the two places, but little could
be said for it for some time. Dr. Mountain, the son of the first
Anglican bishop of Quebec, and himself afterwards third bishop
of Quebec, accompanied his father on an episcopal trip into Upper
Canada in 1820. Among the places he visited was Perth. Of the
road he said: "All the roads I have described before were turnpike
and bowling green to this."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The road was divided into three
stages of seven miles each, and the best the party could do was
three hours for each stage.</p>

<p>In 1818, another settlement was formed in the same part of
the country about thirty miles north of Perth. It was a military
settlement, being made up of officers and men of the 99th and 100th
regiments. This group did not enter upon its lands by way of the
St. Lawrence, but is notable as the first considerable body to come
into Upper Canada by way of the Ottawa river. They landed on
the site of the present city of Ottawa, but did not stop there longer
than was necessary to break a road through to their lands, which
were situated about twenty miles to the westward. The settlement
was called Richmond, in honour of the Duke of Richmond, the
governor general, and this circumstance gave Ottawa its first
name&mdash;Richmond Landing.</p>

<p>It was at Richmond that the duke came to his melancholy end
that same summer, as the result of the bite of a fox. The duke
had shown his interest in the settlement which bore his name in
a number of ways, and shortly before his death he induced the
deputy postmaster general to open a post office there. In order
to provide it with mails, a blazed trail was made between the new
settlement and Perth.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The settlement at Richmond was not the first, however, in
the Upper Ottawa district. In 1800, Philemon Wright, a New
Englander, who had made one or two exploratory tours into the
country, determined to form a settlement at Hull, on the Lower
Canadian side of the river, and in that year he brought with him
a group of his neighbours from Malden, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>These settlers were thrifty and intelligent, and by 1815, they had
brought their settlement to a pitch of prosperity, which won
special mention from Bouchette, the surveyor general. At that
time there were about thirty families in the district, whose farms
were in a respectable state of cultivation; and a large trade in
timber, pot and pearl ashes was carried on.</p>

<p>The little settlement was so far from Montreal&mdash;one hundred
and twenty miles&mdash;that it was at first impracticable to give it the
benefit of the postal service. The isolation did not last long.
Little bodies of settlers were taking up land at different points,
both above and below the Long Sault rapids; and for some time
before 1819, there had been a steamer running between Lachine
and Carillon, at the foot of the Long Sault.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>In 1819, a steamer was put on the Upper Ottawa, running
between the head of the Long Sault and Hull, and the Duke of
Richmond appealed to Sutherland to open post offices on the river
route. The deputy postmaster general at first demurred on the
ground of expense, but he withdrew his objections on a guarantee
being given by a number of gentlemen interested in the district,
that the post office should be saved against any loss which might
ensue. Offices were accordingly opened at St. Eustache and St.
Andrews on the lower Ottawa, and at Grenville, Hawkesbury and
Hull on the upper part of the river.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Another part of the country to which the postal system was
extended during this period was the eastern townships in Lower
Canada. These townships lie along the northern border of eastern
New York, Vermont and New Hampshire. Owing to their contiguity
to the United States, the settlement of these townships
gave the British Government much concern.</p>

<p>Lord North, at the close of the war of the Revolution, desired
to settle this border country with old soldiers. Haldimand, the
governor general, was of another opinion, believing that the
interests of peace would be best served by keeping the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
uncultivated, that it might serve as a barrier to the restless spirits
from the south. Some effort was made to give effect to this view
but without much success. Indeed the governors who followed
Haldimand made grants in the townships freely; and in 1812, it
was estimated that there were not less than 17,000 people settled
there.</p>

<p>Lord Bathurst, the colonial secretary, on learning in 1816 the
state of affairs, was highly displeased that the policy of the government
had been disregarded in this manner, and directed the
governor to do what he could to discourage further settlement,
and wherever possible to restore the cultivated country to a state
of nature.</p>

<p>Mentioning particularly the townships at the western end of
the province, the colonial secretary directed that no new roads
were to be run into them, and advantage was to be taken of any
circumstances that presented themselves of letting the roads
already made fall into disuse. For five years this desolating policy
was carried into execution.</p>

<p>In 1821, Lord Dalhousie, the governor general reported that the
result was an utter failure. "These townships," he says "are
the resort of all the felons escaping from justice within His Majesty's
province or from the United States. Forgery, coining, and every
crime is committed there with impunity. American lumbermen
are cutting everywhere the best timber, and sit down where they
please, and move about where they find it convenient."</p>

<p>A reversal of the mistaken policy resulted from the Dalhousie
report. The first post office opened in the townships was at
Stanstead,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> the centre of a comfortable, well-settled population of
about 2500. The village lay on the main stage route from Quebec
into the state of Vermont. The post office at Stanstead was
opened in 1817, and with three other offices opened at the same time
had a weekly exchange of mails with Quebec by way of Three Rivers.</p>

<p>During Sutherland's administration, there were a considerable
number of post offices opened, and many of them established at
this period afterwards attained great importance. In 1816, when
he became deputy postmaster general, there were only ten offices
in Lower Canada and nine in Upper Canada. When he retired
in 1827, there were forty-nine in Lower Canada and sixty-five in
Upper Canada. In 1816, Belleville post office was opened under
the name of bay of Quinte: in 1825, Hamilton, London, Brantford,
and St. Thomas were provided with post offices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lower Canada, besides those already mentioned, a post office
was opened at Sherbrooke in 1819, replacing an office established
in Aston township in 1817.</p>

<p>A curious fact appears in the post office list of 1819. At this
date Toronto was still called York, and Hamilton was without a
post office altogether. Nevertheless a post office called Toronto
was on the list of 1819 as having been opened in 1817, with Charles
Fothergill as postmaster, and another called Hamilton was opened
in 1819 with James Bethune as postmaster. There was nothing
to indicate where these post offices were situated until changes
were made in the names, and Toronto was converted into Port
Hope and Hamilton into Cobourg.</p>

<p>Fothergill, who had the post office established at Port Hope,
appears more than once in the course of post office history. He
was member of the house of assembly and king's printer, as well
as postmaster. About this time the house began to express dissatisfaction
with the service provided by the post office, and to
demand information as to its affairs, which the deputy postmaster
general was not prepared to furnish. Among the critics was
Fothergill, who was speedily punished for his independence. He
was dismissed from the office of king's printer by the governor.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The conveyance of the mails between Canada and Great Britain
occupied much attention during Sutherland's term. The packets,
that is the vessels employed expressly for the conveyance of the
mails, had at this date almost ceased to be employed for the transmission
of any but official correspondence. The interests of the
governors and other officials in British North America and Bermuda,
and of the British minister at Washington and consuls in the
United States, were the only interests considered in the arrangements
for this service.</p>

<p>Speedy transmission was sacrificed without a thought, to
provide against imagined dangers to safe transmission. When
the packet service was established, the vessels made monthly trips
during the summer from Falmouth, in England, to Halifax and
thence to New York, returning by the same route. The mails for
Bermuda were landed at Halifax, and taken to their destination
in a war vessel.</p>

<p>During the winter, the vessels from Falmouth did not run to
Halifax, but proceeded directly to New York. In 1806, at the
instance of the admiralty, orders were given that, whenever possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
during the winter, the packets should touch at Bermuda on their
way to New York.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> On the eve of the war of 1812, Prevost, the
governor general, who was fearful for the safety of the mails,
begged that this course might be adopted as the regular winter
course, and that mails for Canada and other parts of British North
America should be put off at Bermuda, and conveyed from there
to Halifax.</p>

<p>To make the mails for Canada go as far south as Bermuda
seems outrageous, but Prevost was willing to put up with any
slowness in transmission rather than have his despatches touch
United States soil. This course was pursued until the war ended
in 1815, and continued for many winters after that time.</p>

<p>But it was too bad to escape criticism from officials themselves.
At the end of the summer of 1816, when the packets were about
to be taken off the Halifax route, the rear-admiral on the North
American station asked that the packets should continue to call
at Halifax during the winter, and, by way of satisfying the post
office of the feasibility of his suggestion, furnished a list of some
seventy vessels which had entered Halifax during the previous
winter, which was allowed to be the severest for many years, and
found no more trouble in making this port than the port of New
York.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion aroused great opposition&mdash;an opposition which
would be quite incomprehensible to-day. The agent of the packet
service at Falmouth assembled all commanders who happened to
be in port, and asked them their opinion. They were unanimous
in the belief that the only safe course to Halifax would be to go
first to Bermuda, thence to New York, and finally to Halifax.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
The prevalence of north-westerly winds during the winter would
make a direct sailing from Falmouth to Halifax impracticable.</p>

<p>The commanders did not consider it advisable, however, to
adopt this course, as it would lengthen the trip by from two to three
weeks, and as the voyages would be much rougher, there would
be few passengers. The wear and tear on the packets would be
greater, and besides the men would require great coats and
spirits. During the late war each packet took sixty gallons of rum
each way.</p>

<p>Lord Dalhousie became governor general in 1819 and he made
bitter complaint of the length of time taken in the delivery of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
winter despatches.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The despatches leaving England in November
1821 and 1822, did not reach him until the following February,
and his February despatches arrived in Quebec in May. He asked
that the mails containing his correspondence should not be put
off the packet at Bermuda, but that they be carried to New York,
where he would have his messenger on hand to receive them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see why this should not have been done. Ever
since the establishment of peace in 1783, there had been a British
packet agent at New York, whose sole duty it was to act as intermediary
for the despatch by the outgoing British packet boat, of
all correspondence reaching him from the governors or other
officials in British North America, or from the ambassadors or
consuls in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Dalhousie's messenger took his outgoing despatches to the
packet agent, and the governor could not understand the objections
to allowing the same messenger to carry the incoming despatches
back with him. The packet agent at New York strongly supported
the governor's request, and pointed out how his own office might
be made of much greater utility, if he were employed freely, not
only for the transmission of official correspondence, but for the
interchange of general correspondence between Canada and Great
Britain. He declared that the United States government had
shown the utmost courtesy to the governor's messengers. They
had not been molested in any way, and for some time past, the
earlier practice of requiring the couriers to be provided with passports
had been allowed to drop.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The agent proposed that during the winter the English exchange
office should make up separate bags for Upper and Lower Canada,
which on arrival at New York would be delivered to his office.
He would then see that the bags were forwarded by special
messenger without delay.</p>

<p>His plan, however, was open to strong objection, and the British
post office, which was averse to making any change in the direction
proposed, was quick to seize upon it. While acknowledging the
good will of the United States government regarding the conveyance
of official despatches through their territory by British messengers,
the secretary stated that the conveyance of ordinary mails by the
same means was a very different matter, which would give rise to
a justifiable claim on the part of the United States department,
and if the charges which would have to be paid to the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
States department were added to the other postage rates, the
total postage to be collected from the recipients of the letters would
be very large.</p>

<p>But the argument of the secretary was based on the supposition
that the mails would be carried as the despatches were, by Canadian
messengers from New York, and that the letters they carried would
be subject to a double charge, viz:&mdash;the expenses of the messenger,
and the sum which the United States might exact for the mere
transit over its territory. If the British mails arriving at New
York by the packet were handed over to the United States post
office for transmission, as had been the case before the war of
1812, there would have been no such excessive charge.</p>

<p>This was what was desired on all sides in Canada. The service
would have been much faster, and for Montreal and all places in
Upper Canada the postage would have been lower. Since the
spring of 1817, steamboats were employed to carry the mails
between New York and Albany twice a week, and with other
improvements on the route, the time between New York and
Montreal was shortened to three days in summer and five in winter.</p>

<p>From New York to York took from nine to eleven days by way
of Montreal, and a day less if the mails were carried from New
York along the Mohawk valley route to Queenston on the Niagara
river, and thence to York.</p>

<p>Compare this with the time occupied between Halifax and
Quebec. A month was the average, and to that had to be added
two days to Montreal and eight days to York. No advantage
enjoyed by Halifax over New York on the sea trip could compensate
for the disparity from which the land route between Halifax and
Montreal suffered in comparison with the route from New York to
Montreal, and as Montreal was the gateway to Upper Canada, the
whole of the new province suffered in equal measure with that city.</p>

<p>The gain in time by the New York route was submitted to the
general post office, but the proposition to land the mails at that
port was opposed by the secretary. He found that there would be
eightpence less postage on each letter to Quebec, if it were sent
through the United States instead of through the Maritime
provinces, and, besides, he was doubtful as to the propriety of
sanctioning any scheme which would permit private and mercantile
letters to reach Quebec before the government despatches, which
in any case must come by way of Halifax.</p>

<p>But though the comings and the goings of the packets were a
matter of much concern to Lord Dalhousie and to others, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
correspondence had to be carried by this means, they were of
little moment to the general public, who had found a very satisfactory
means for the conveyance of their correspondence.</p>

<p>In 1826, the treasury set on foot inquiries as to the arrangements
for the conveyance of correspondence across the Atlantic, and the
information they obtained must have surprised them.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> There
were three modes of sending letters to Canada from Great Britain.
The first was by the official sailing packets. The usefulness of the
packets, however, was limited to the conveyance of official
despatches.</p>

<p>The high charges and the slowness of the service abundantly
account for the failure of the public to employ this means of
transmission. The postage on a single letter, that is a single sheet
of paper weighing less than an ounce, was two shillings and twopence
sterling from London to Halifax by way of Falmouth. To
this must be added the postage from Halifax to points in Canada,
which was one shilling and eightpence to Quebec; one shilling and
tenpence to Montreal; two shillings and twopence to Kingston;
two shillings and sixpence to York; and three shillings to
Amherstburg.</p>

<p>Thus, employing the more familiar decimal currency, the
postage on a single sheet, weighing less than one ounce, posted in
London and sent by packet to Halifax and thence to its destination
in Canada was, to Quebec ninety-two cents; to Montreal ninety-six
cents; to Kingston one dollar and four cents; to York one dollar
and twelve cents; and to Amherstburg one dollar and twenty-four
cents. Remembering Dalhousie's complaint that it took
upwards of seventy days for one of these precious letters to reach
him, the unpopularity of the packet service can be appreciated.</p>

<p>The second agency for conveying letters from England to
Canada, was by private ship, but through the medium of the post
office. A person desiring to send a letter from London to a post
office in Canada would write on the cover a direction that the letter
was to be sent by a ship which he would name, and post it in the
ordinary way.</p>

<p>The post office would accept the direction, and would charge
just one half the packet postage for the conveyance to Halifax
or Quebec, that is, instead of two shillings and twopence for the
sea conveyance, the letter would only be charged one shilling and
one penny. But the high charges between the port of arrival in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
British North America and the offices in inland Canada prevented
the extensive use of this means of conveyance.</p>

<p>The third mode of conveyance was irregular, but it was universally
employed. There were lines of sailing vessels, called
American packets, running between Liverpool and New York,
which were fast sailers, and which would carry letters from England
to the United States for twopence a letter, without regard to its
weight or the number of enclosures it contained.</p>

<p>The agents of these lines kept bags in their offices in London
and Liverpool, and when the vessels were due to sail, the bags
were sealed and placed on board. The conveyance of the letter
bags from London to Liverpool by the messengers of the sailing
lines was illegal, as the postmaster general had the exclusive right
to convey letters within the United Kingdom. There could have
been no possibility of carrying on the traffic in a clandestine manner,
as it was wholesale in character, and comprised the correspondence
of the most eminent merchants in London. On inquiry it was
learned that one merchant alone sent one thousand letters by this
means, and not one by the official packets, and the practice was
universal.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of the American packets at New York, the letters
for Canada were deposited in the New York post office, and
forwarded to the Canadian border office in the United States
mails, and thence to their destination. The postage by this course
was very much less than by either of the other routes.</p>

<p>It was made up of three factors: the ocean postage of four
cents, the United States postage of nineteen or twenty-five cents&mdash;according
to the point at which the Canadian border was reached&mdash;and
the inland Canadian postage. The charge on a single letter
to Quebec was forty-seven cents instead of ninety-two cents, which
would be due if sent by the packet route. To Montreal, Kingston,
York and Amherstburg, the postage on a letter from London or
Liverpool was thirty-one cents, forty-seven cents, forty-one cents
and sixty-one cents, as against ninety-six cents, one dollar and four
cents, one dollar and twelve cents and one dollar and twenty-four
cents respectively.</p>

<p>Letters to York coming from New York had the advantage of
a daily conveyance to Lewiston, where the transfer to the Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
border office at Queenstown was made, and of the lower charges
which the United States post office imposed for long distances.
These figures, the lowest then attainable, inevitably suggest
comparisons.</p>

<p>It is only a few years since good citizens were rejoicing that the
postage rate between the mother country and Canada was brought
down from five cents to two cents a letter. Here was a link of
empire of daily utility. Communication could be kept up between
the British immigrant and his friends at home without too heavy
a draft on slender purses. His heart would remain British, and as
he prospered he would induce others of his friends and neighbours
to come over and settle.</p>

<p>A glance backward will show how little these agencies of empire
were able to effect in our grandfather's time. The lowest possible
postage charge from London to York fifty years ago was forty-one
cents, and that would carry no more than one sheet of paper
weighing less than an ounce. If within the folds of this sheet were
found another piece of paper no larger than a postage stamp, the
charge of conveyance from New York to York was doubled, and
with the ocean postage of four cents, the poor immigrant would
have to pay seventy-eight cents for his letter.</p>

<p>If the letter weighed an ounce, that is, if it were such a letter
as would pass anywhere within the British Empire for four cents,
the charge for it coming from London to York would be one dollar
and fifty-two cents. Finally, if this ounce letter were sent by the
All-Red route, that is by the British packet to Halifax and thence
over British soil to York, the postage charge would be four dollars
and forty-eight cents. Imperial sentiment must have rivalled wit
in economy of expression in those days.</p>

<p>While the British post office was unwilling to encourage the
use of the United States mails for the conveyance of letters between
Canada and Great Britain, it was anxious to put the British packet
service on a better footing. But the service had been going from
bad to worse, and it had reached a stage where it satisfied nobody.</p>

<p>Of the three points to which mails were carried&mdash;Halifax, New
York and Bermuda&mdash;the last named always held the position of
advantage during the winter. Until the winter of 1826 the packet
called first at Bermuda, leaving Canadian mails there, and continuing
on to New York. At the beginning of the winter of 1826 a
change was made.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The packet sailed to Bermuda, put off the
United States mails there, and sailed northward to Halifax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
omitting New York. The United States mails were conveyed by
mail boat from Bermuda to Annapolis, Maryland.</p>

<p>This scheme remedied none of the defects of its predecessor,
and brought with it the additional disadvantage that it cut off all
direct connection between the British minister at Washington,
and the governors of the British colonies.</p>

<p>The secretary of the post office in explaining the arrangements
to the postmaster general washed his hands of all responsibility
for them. He declared that the plan originated with the admiralty,
and was sanctioned by the foreign and colonial secretaries as a
practical measure. The postmaster general on reviewing the
correspondence was not surprised at the general dissatisfaction,
and was glad that the arrangements could not be laid at the door
of the post office.</p>

<p>The ocean mail service was beyond the control of the deputy
postmaster general of Canada. The postal relations with the
United States were not, and he exerted himself to improve these.
A hardship under which Canadian merchants doing business with
the United States laboured was that they had to pay the postage
on all their letters as far as the United States border.</p>

<p>It will be difficult to-day to see wherein the grievance of the
early Canadian merchants lay. But at that time the postage
was a considerable item in every transaction, and the merchant
could not afford to disregard it. When he sold a bill of goods to
a customer in the United States, he was obliged to throw on the
customer the burden of the postage on the correspondence relating
to the goods, and the only sure way of doing this was to post the
letters unpaid, and leave the customer to pay the postage on the
delivery of the letters. If he had to pay from eight to twenty
cents which were required to take each single letter as far as the
border, he was apt to lose this sum.</p>

<p>To protect themselves the Canadian merchants used to employ
private messengers to carry their letters as far as the nearest post
office in the United States, and post them there. From this
United States office the letters would go to their destination without
pre-payment.</p>

<p>Sutherland informed the postmaster general that some of the
leading mercantile houses in Canada sent hundreds of letters into
the United States by private hand.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The United States merchant selling goods in Canada stood in
a better position as regards his correspondence. He was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
post his letters for Canada unpaid, and the letter came into Canada
and went to its destination, where the person addressed paid the
postage on delivery of the letter. This was made possible by an
arrangement between the deputy postmaster general of Canada,
and the post office department at Washington, by which the
former undertook to collect and pay over to the latter the share
of the postage which was due to the United States department,
receiving twenty per cent. for his trouble.</p>

<p>The arrangement was a purely private one, for which Sutherland
did not feel called upon to account to the general post office.
What he desired was that there should be some postmaster in the
United States who would act as agent for the collection of Canadian
postage on letters entering the United States from Canada, and he
found the postmaster of Swanton, Vermont, quite willing to act
in this capacity.</p>

<p>As Swanton was the United States post office through which
all correspondence passed from Lower Canada into the United
States, the postmaster was well situated for this duty. The only
difficulty was about the commission of twenty per cent., which
would have to be paid to the postmaster as compensation. It
was necessary to obtain the consent of the British post office to
this arrangement, as the deputy postmaster general had no power
to make abatements in the postage due to Canada, without the
authority of the postmaster general.</p>

<p>But this consent the postmaster general was not disposed to
give.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Besides the objection that the Canadian post office would
receive only eighty per cent. of the postage due on letters going
to the United States, the secretary suggested to the postmaster
general that it would seem inadvisable, politically, to encourage
unlimited correspondence between all sorts of persons in the
two countries, without possibility of restriction or of learning
(should it be necessary) with whom any particular person was
in correspondence.</p>

<p>Indeed, the secretary had his doubts as to the legality of the
arrangement by which Sutherland acted as agent for the collection
of the United States postage on letters coming from that country
into Canada. The rates of postage, said he, are distinctly specified
in various acts of parliament, and the Canadian post office had
no power to demand more than the sum required by the statutes.
If it were thought advisable to have Canadian postmasters collect
United States postage, a new legislative provision would have to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
made, which would lead to similar applications from other countries,
and the result would be confusion and loss of revenue.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the consequence of a strict interpretation
of the law, as intimated by the postmaster general,
the deputy postmaster general did not discontinue the convenient,
and, to him, profitable practice of providing for the transmission
of unpaid letters from the United States addressed to Canada.</p>

<p>So far from that, Sutherland improved on this arrangement.
At the solicitation of Canadian merchants, he obtained the consent
of the United States department to having British mails, landed
at New York, passed on to Canada without being held for the
United States postage. The postage due for the conveyance of
the letters through the United States was collected by the deputy
postmaster general, and transmitted by him to Washington, and
the delays incident to having this work done in the United States
were avoided.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>On the 15th of February, 1825, a memorial<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> was addressed to the
British government by the Marquess of Ormonde, the Knight of
Kerry and Simon McGillivray, proposing to establish communication
between Great Britain and the British North American colonies
by steam vessels, and asking for the exclusive privilege of providing
such a service for fourteen years.</p>

<p>At this time steamboats were in pretty general use in the inland
and coastal waters of Great Britain, United States and Canada,
but nothing had up to this time been done to demonstrate that it
would be practicable to cross the Atlantic by a steamboat.</p>

<p>In 1819, a sailing vessel, the "Savannah," fitted up with a
boiler and engine and provided with a pair of paddles which could
be hauled on deck at will, started from Savannah, Georgia, for
Liverpool. The voyage occupied twenty-seven days. Only for
three days and eight hours was the "Savannah" under steam.</p>

<p>There was nothing in this experiment to induce the conviction
that steam could be successfully employed as a means of propulsion
on the transatlantic service, and as a matter of fact the machinery
was removed from the "Savannah" on her return to her American
port, and she spent the rest of a short existence as an ordinary
sailing vessel between New York and Savannah.</p>

<p>Lord Ormonde and his associates were convinced of the practicability
of steam navigation across the Atlantic, but to make an
enterprise of that kind a success, they would have to satisfy the
public on the point, and this would involve a large outlay. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
asking for a fourteen years' monopoly, they argued that their
proposition would not produce the ordinary ill-effects of a monopoly,
as any tendency they might exhibit towards excessive charges
would be held in check by sailing vessels, and by steamships,
which would inevitably be run between the United States and
ports on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>The proposed line was to consist of six vessels, three of
1000 tons, and three of 600 tons, which would make their
way across the Atlantic in pairs, one large and one small
steamer. The vessels would sail together between Valentia,
Ireland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. On arrival at Halifax, the
vessels would separate, one going to New York and the other to
Quebec. When the two vessels reached Valentia on the voyage
home, one would proceed to Glasgow, and the other to Bristol.
The memorial was not entertained, and the project dropped.</p>

<p>Sutherland, in his personal relations, showed much more tact
than Heriot; and in the controversies which arose between him
and the colonial legislatures, Sutherland contrived to range himself
on the side of the governors, thus making the post office one of
the matters of which the ultra-British parties undertook the defence
against the attacks of the Radicals.</p>

<p>But the situation of the deputy postmaster general was too
difficult for him to secure unalloyed success. The various interests
he had to serve, and, as far as possible, to reconcile, were too
antagonistic for complete success. On the one side was a country
being settled rapidly and clamouring for postal service in all directions.
On the other stood the general post office fixed in its
determination that its profits should not be diminished, and
scanning anxiously every fresh item of expenditure.</p>

<p>Any serious inclination in one direction was sure to arouse
resentment in the other. A curious instance of this occurred in
1819, three years after Sutherland had taken office. A number
of merchants and others in Montreal appointed a committee to
wait on the deputy postmaster general with a memorial containing
an expression of their opinions and desires respecting the postal
service in Canada.</p>

<p>The post office in Montreal it was urged had become unsuitable
as regards site and space for the accommodation of the public,
and the assistance employed by the postmaster was unequal to
the requirements of an efficient service. The communications
with the United States, Upper Canada and within the province,
should be increased in frequency, and an interchange of mails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
should be opened with the Genesee and other settlements in New
York state by way of Prescott and Ogdensburg. The memorialists
also desired that letters might be sent to the United States without
prepayment of postage.</p>

<p>Sutherland, in his reply to the memorial, dealt with the committee
with an engaging frankness.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> He was well aware, he said,
that the accommodation in Montreal post office was inadequate,
but what was to be done? The postmaster had only £300 a year
salary, and out of that he had to pay office rent and stationery.
It was not to be wondered at, that the postmaster endeavoured
to economize in every way possible. He, himself, had on more
than one occasion advised the postmaster general of the necessity
for greater clerical help, but so far without the desired effect.</p>

<p>Only the year before, Sutherland told the memorialists, he had
submitted to the postmaster general with his strongest recommendation,
a petition from the postmaster of Montreal for
increased salary and assistance, but the petition was refused. As
for the increase in the frequency of the communications it was
beyond his power to authorize such an expenditure. He had done
his best on two recent occasions to induce the postmaster general
to allow letters to go into the United States without the prepayment
of postage, but was told that British postage must be paid on
letters going into foreign states.</p>

<p>The memorial and Sutherland's reply were transmitted to
the general post office. There they excited much indignation.
Freeling, the secretary, in a minute to the postmaster general,
professed his inability to understand whether this unreserved
disclosure of Sutherland's proceeded merely from indiscretion or
from some other motive. The postmaster general was, in effect,
accused of inattention and supineness in the discharge of his
duties. His decisions were placed in the most invidious light
before the inhabitants of Montreal.</p>

<p>Indeed the whole circumstance had to Freeling the air of an
understanding between Sutherland and the committee. The
postmaster general was equally indignant, and ordered Sutherland's
dismissal. But, as so often happened, Freeling changed his attitude,
urging a number of countervailing circumstances against this
extreme measure, and the postmaster general, who appeared to
do little more than to convert the opinions and suggestions which
Freeling so humbly submitted into departmental decisions,
concurred in this recommendation.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1824, Sutherland met with a serious financial loss. The
postmaster at Montreal became a defaulter to the extent of £1706.
Sutherland took action against the postmaster's sureties, but
owing to informalities his suit was thrown out. He appealed to
the general post office, alleging that the reason of his non-suit was
its failure to answer certain questions which he had put to the
postmaster general. The appeal was not allowed. In 1827,
Sutherland retired owing to ill-health, and was succeeded by his
son-in-law, Thomas Allen Stayner, the last and, in some respects,
the most distinguished of the representatives of the British post
office in Canada.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Postal conditions in Upper Canada&mdash;Serious abuses&mdash;Agitation for provincial
control.</p></div>


<p>To those who have followed the course of events thus far, noting
the uncompromising attitude of the general post office towards all
propositions for the extension of the postal system in Canada,
it will be obvious that a struggle for the means of communication
impended, which the rapid growth of the country was fast
precipitating.</p>

<p>The general post office claimed that it, and it alone, had power
to establish a postal service in any part of the country, and it used
its arrogated powers in the same manner as any commercial
monopoly would be exercised. Post offices were opened in all
the better settled parts of the country, where they could be operated
profitably. They were refused in the newer districts, unless
satisfactory guarantees were given that there would be no loss in
working them.</p>

<p>A population was coming into the country rapidly, and was
tending towards the inland parts of the province far from the line
of post offices which skirted the shores of the St. Lawrence and
lake Ontario, and the situation was becoming embarrassing, as well
as humiliating to the sensitive pride of the people.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to open post offices on the route pursued
by the mail courier from the eastern boundary of the province
to Niagara. But it was frequently expensive to open new routes,
and the provincial government of Upper Canada was disinclined
to give guarantees against loss on particular routes, while it had
evidence that considerable profits were being taken from the
older routes, and sent to the general post office in London.</p>

<p>Just how acute the position of matters was becoming will be
clear from a survey of the distribution of population in Upper
Canada at this time, with a view of the post offices provided for
the accommodation of the several parts. We are able to throw
out our sketch of the state of settlement in Upper Canada, by
employing the results of the census of 1824.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>The total population of the province in 1824 was 149,941, of
whom 63,000 were in the western district, that is, west of York.
Between the eastern boundary of the province and York, there
were twenty-six post offices. Four of these&mdash;Perth, Lanark,
Richmond and Hawkesbury&mdash;served inland settlements, the
nearest of which was over twenty-five miles from the St. Lawrence.
The line of settlements which these four offices served was scattered
over a territory over one hundred miles in length, and from twenty
to thirty in width. It comprised a population of 12,476.</p>

<p>The remaining twenty-two offices, east of York, were, with one
exception, situated on the shores of the river St. Lawrence and
lake Ontario. Each afforded accommodation to a district about
fourteen miles in length, and between twenty and thirty miles in
depth. The mails were carried twice a week over this route.
These arrangements gave a fair service to the settlements through
which the couriers passed, but they compared meanly with the
daily service from New York to Buffalo, on the other side of lake
Ontario.</p>

<p>But it was the inland settlements west of York that had most
reason to complain of the lack of facilities for communication.
The Niagara peninsula, embracing the territory between lake
Ontario and lake Erie, and lying west of a line dropped perpendicularly
from Hamilton to lake Erie, contained a population of
20,000, distributed with fair evenness over a stretch of country
forty-five miles in length, and from twenty-five to thirty in breadth.</p>

<p>The people of this district were served by four offices on its
northern border&mdash;Dundas, Grimsby, St. Catherines and Niagara&mdash;and
one office&mdash;Queenstown&mdash;on its eastern border. Although
there were settlements in every part of the district, there was not
a single post office within it on the lake Erie shore, or, indeed,
anywhere farther inland than three miles from the shore of lake
Ontario, or of the Niagara river.</p>

<p>Poorly provided as the Niagara district was, the people living
in it had less ground for grievance in respect of post office facilities
than the settlers in the London district. This district was an
immense irregular block made up of the counties of Middlesex,
Oxford, Brant, Norfolk and Elgin. It measured eighty miles in
length, and from forty to fifty miles in depth. It contained in
1824 a population of 16,588, which, as in the other districts, was
distributed through every part.</p>

<p>This great district had but five post offices in it, one in each
county. The two offices on the lake Erie shore&mdash;Vittoria and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Port Talbot&mdash;were sixty miles apart; while the three offices&mdash;Burford,
Woodstock and Delaware&mdash;were twenty miles from lake
Erie.</p>

<p>As illustrating the difficulty of moving the general post office
to recognize the responsibility, which its claims of a monopoly
seemed to impose on it, Dr. Rolph, who represented the county of
Middlesex in the house of assembly, stated<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> that before the post
office was opened at Delaware, he had made application to the
deputy postmaster general for a post office in Middlesex county,
and was told that the office would be established in the county
if he would guarantee the expenses of the conveyance of the mails,
but that his application could not be considered on any other
terms.</p>

<p>As individual effort was plainly hopeless, the subject was
taken up by the house of assembly of Upper Canada. The house
dealt with the question vigorously, but not on the lines suggested
by the foregoing review of the state of the postal service. More
serious aspects of the case engaged their attention. Men on the
streets and in farm houses believed that they were victims of
imposition on the part of the deputy postmaster general, and that
he was charging them more for the conveyance of their letters
than the imperial statutes warranted, high as the legitimate
charges were.</p>

<p>Discussion on these grievances brought the people forward to
another point, and they asked themselves by what right the
British government imposed on a self-governing community an
institution like the post office, which not only fixed its charges
without reference to the people of Upper Canada, but which insisted
on preventing the people from establishing an institution
of the same sort under their own authority.</p>

<p>It was to these questions that the house of assembly addressed
itself. The rates of postage which were charged in Canada, were
collected under the authority of an act of the imperial parliament
passed in 1765. This act amended the act of Queen Anne's reign,
which was regarded as the charter of the post office in British
America.</p>

<p>The rates, as fixed by the act of 1765, were, for a single sheet of
paper weighing less than an ounce, fourpence-halfpenny currency,
if the distance the letter was carried did not exceed sixty miles;
if the distance were from sixty to one hundred miles, the charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
was sevenpence; from one hundred to two hundred miles, ninepence,
and for every one hundred miles beyond two hundred
miles, twopence.</p>

<p>The first inquiry of the house was as to whether these rates,
and no more, were charged for conveyance in Upper Canada.
On February 29, 1820, William Allan, postmaster of York, was
called to the bar of the house, and questioned as to the rates
charged by him for letters to the several post offices in Upper
Canada.</p>

<p>Allan did not know the distance to the post offices, but he
furnished the table of rates which had been given to him. The
house asked one of its members, Mahlon Burwell, a land surveyor,
to state the several distances, when it appeared that every rate
charged by the postmaster of York, was higher than the imperial
act warranted.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Thus the legal charge on a letter to Dundas was fourpence-halfpenny.
The charge made by the postmaster of York was
sevenpence. On letters to Grimsby, St. Catharines, Niagara and
Queenston, the legal charge was sevenpence&mdash;Allan charged tenpence.
Amherstburg, which was at the western limit of the
province, was between two hundred and three hundred miles from
York, and the charge should have been elevenpence. Instead of
this sixteen pence was charged.</p>

<p>So far the house had made out its case, and on the following
day it adopted a resolution that for several years past the rates of
postage charged in Upper Canada had exceeded the charges
authorized by law, and that the lieutenant governor should be
requested to submit the question to the imperial authorities for
a remedy.</p>

<p>Peregrine Maitland, the lieutenant governor, did as he was
requested, and, when the resolution came before the postmaster
general in England, Freeling, the secretary of the general post
office, admitted, in reply<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> to the postmaster general's request for
information, that the rates in British North America were regulated
by the imperial act of 1765, but he held that there were other
circumstances to be considered.</p>

<p>Freeling did not know whether the ordinary rates would produce
sufficient revenue to cover the expenses of the service. If not,
then he would refer the postmaster general to a letter written by
General Hunter, the lieutenant governor in 1800, which contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
an undertaking on the part of the lieutenant governor that, in
case there was a deficit, the amount of the shortage would be made
good either from the contingencies of the province, or by a vote
of the legislature. Freeling would call upon the deputy postmaster
general in Canada to report whether the legal postage would
be equal to the expense. If so, there was no reason to require
the province to grant any aid.</p>

<p>This explanation, like so many which had to be made at that
period, lacked the essential element of sincerity. Hunter's engagement
was to make good deficits, not by allowing illegal postal
charges to be made, but by withdrawing the amount of the deficit
from the provincial treasury. This was a point on which Freeling
himself insisted on several occasions.</p>

<p>In Sir Gordon Drummond's time, there was an application
from the military authorities for a more frequent service between
Kingston and Montreal, which was coupled with an offer to pay
such extra postage as would be necessary to cover the cost of the
service desired. Freeling declared that such an offer could not
be accepted, unless the additional charges were sanctioned by
the British parliament.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Another case, involving the same principle, arose about this
time. Sutherland, the deputy postmaster general, desired to
facilitate the interchange of correspondence with the United States,
and reported to the postmaster general that he had arranged to
have the American postage on letters coming from the United
States to Canada collected by postmasters in Canada, at the same
time as they collected the Canadian postage. Freeling objected
to this arrangement as of doubtful legality, on the ground that the
act of 1765 prescribed the amount which postmasters should take
on every letter, and it might be necessary to amend the act to
permit this scheme.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The house of assembly, however, did not wait for the answer
to their remonstrance. In the following session they gave themselves
up to the consideration of the more vital questions, as to
"how far the present system is sanctioned by law, and whether
and in what manner the same can be beneficially altered." This
was not the first occasion on which the right of the British post
office to collect postage in Canada was called in question.</p>

<p>Governor Simcoe, in 1791,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> assumed it as indisputable that,
when a postal system was established in Upper Canada, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
be under the control of the legislature, unless the British government
by express enactment, retained the management of it in the
hands of the British post office, paying over to the local government
all surplus revenues arising therefrom. The question was
not decided at that time, and it was only when the course pursued
by the general post office was so unsatisfactory to Canadians that
it was again raised.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed in 1821, to investigate the subject
with Dr. W. W. Baldwin as chairman. On December 10 the
report was laid before the assembly.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The committee had little
help from the post office in pursuit of its inquiries. The only
official available, the postmaster of York, was examined, but
whether from unwillingness or want of knowledge, he contributed
little information to the inquiry.</p>

<p>Allan stated that he was appointed by the deputy postmaster
general under his hand and seal. He occasionally received instructions
from the deputy postmaster general, but had no idea as to
the authority under which the latter acted. He had never been
referred to any particular statute for his guidance, and, indeed, the
postage on letters within the province had been charged at arbitrary
rates, which were fixed by the deputy postmaster general.</p>

<p>Some valuable information respecting the revenue of his office
was submitted by Allan, which completely disproved the intimation
of the secretary of the general post office, that the offices in
that part of the country were conducted at a loss. The post office
at York yielded an annual revenue of between £800 and £900,
which was remitted to the deputy postmaster general at Quebec.</p>

<p>The committee found it impracticable to call the postmasters
of the more distant offices, but having regard to all the circumstances,
they were satisfied that there was remitted each year to
the deputy postmaster general at Quebec an amount exceeding
£2500, of which perhaps ten per cent. or eleven per cent. was foreign
postage collected in Canada, and, therefore, due to Great Britain
or the United States.</p>

<p>Next the committee addressed themselves to the question as
to how this surplus was disposed of, which, after deducting the
amount owing to the other postal administrations was probably
more than £2000. Allan believed, though he was unable to give
it as a fact, that the money was passed over to London. What
was beyond doubt, however, was that this revenue in no way
inured to the benefit of Upper Canada.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Assuming, as the committee felt they might safely do, that
the surplus from Canada was made part of the revenue of the
general post office in London, the committee then sought to ascertain
how the revenue of the general post office was dealt with,
and whether any part of it was employed for the benefit of the
colonies.</p>

<p>The post office acts of 1710<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and 1801<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> made this point clear.
It appeared that after certain deductions had been made for
pensions, the revenue of the post office was applied in various specified
ways to the service of Great Britain, the postal rates being
avowedly levied for raising the necessary supplies, and for making
a permanent addition to the public revenue. The committee
could find no instance in which any part of the post office revenues
was devoted to the use of the colonies.</p>

<p>Taking it, then, as established that a sum exceeding £2000
was raised each year in Upper Canada as profit from its post office,
and that this sum was applied, not for the benefit of Upper Canada,
but for the purposes of the public service in Great Britain, the
committee next turned its attention to the laws bearing on the
situation.</p>

<p>There was an act passed in 1778<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> in the hope of staying the
rising rebellion in the American colonies entitled "an act for
removing all doubts and apprehensions concerning taxation by the
parliament of Great Britain in any of the colonies and plantations
in North America and the West Indies." It declared that the king
and parliament would not impose any duty, tax or assessment
whatever, payable in any of the colonies in North America or the
West Indies, except any such duties as it might be expedient to
impose for the regulation of commerce.</p>

<p>But although the collection of such duties should be made by
officials of the British government, it was not intended that the
proceeds should go into the British treasury; for it was provided
that the net produce from them should be paid over to the colony
in which they were levied, to form part of the general revenue of
such colony. This seems sufficiently explicit, but that there might
be no doubt as to the applicability of the provisions of this act to
the provinces of Canada, they were expressly incorporated in the
constitutional act of 1791, which was the charter under which the
provinces of Upper and Lower Canada were established.</p>

<p>As in the act of 1778, there was reserved to the British parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in the general interest of the empire, the power to make
laws for the regulation of commerce, but there was also the same
stipulation that the proceeds from such laws should be applied to
the use of the province in which the taxes were levied, and in any
manner the legislature of the province might think fit.</p>

<p>Applying the acts of 1778 and 1791 to the circumstances of
the case in hand, the committee were of opinion that the collection
of postage could not be regarded as a regulation of commerce, and
as such within the scope of imperial legislation.</p>

<p>But even if it should appear that they were wrong in this
opinion, and that the British government had the power to set up
a post office in Upper Canada with the exclusive right to carry
letters within the province, there was one thing the British government
could not properly do. While the constitutional act of 1791
remained unrepealed, the British government could not take the
net produce from the post office in Upper Canada, and use it as
part of the general revenue of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Having satisfied themselves that, however strong the grounds
might be on which the postmaster general of England had proceeded
in establishing a post office in Canada, they could not prevail
against the acts which have been considered, the committee next
gave their attention to inquiring what those grounds might be,
and how far they would bear out the pretensions of the postmaster
general.</p>

<p>The two acts, which it seemed to the committee the postmaster
general would most likely depend upon, were the acts of 1710 and
of 1801. The act of 1710, which was the charter for the post office
in British America, was dismissed from consideration as not even
by its own provisions applying to the colony of Canada, and as
annulled so far as concerned any of the colonies by the act of 1778,
and as regards Canada by the constitutional act of 1791.</p>

<p>The second of the two acts&mdash;that of 1801&mdash;repealed all the
rates of postage enacted by the act of 1710, and fixed new rates for
Great Britain, but made no mention of new colonial rates. Hence,
since 1801, there had been no colonial postage rates having the
sanction of law, and the committee concluded that the colonies
were designedly omitted, when the rates for Great Britain were
fixed by the act of 1801, for the reason that the act of 1778 supervened,
which made it illegal for the British parliament to impose
a tax on a colony for the financial benefit of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The committee admitted that it was a matter for argument
whether the unrepealed parts of the act of 1710 might not be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
applicable to Canada, but conceding the whole argument on this
point, the utmost power remaining in the act was to authorize
the establishment of a postal system in Canada. All power to fix
the postal charges was taken away by the act of 1801.</p>

<p>As for the act of 1801, which established a scale of rates, by no
liberality of construction could it be made to apply to Canada,
because the act of 1778 was against it, and the constitutional act
of 1791 was against it, and the fact that the revenues to be raised
by the act were to be appropriated to the purposes of the United
Kingdom made it illegal for the postmaster general to enforce it
in the province.</p>

<p>There were other acts passed by the imperial parliament
affecting the postage rates, but an examination of these disclosed
no intention to make the acts operative in the colonies. Rates
were fixed for conveyance in the United Kingdom, and to and
from the colonies in America, but nothing was said as to the rates
within the colonies. It was quite clear to the committee, therefore,
that the only acts, which by any possibility could be made applicable
to the colonies, were inoperative in the Canadas.</p>

<p>The committee clinched the argument by a survey of the laws
passed by the British parliament, levying taxes on the colonies.
They showed that whenever such taxes were imposed, the proceeds
were never applied to the purposes of the United Kingdom, but
always to the use of the colony concerned. There was an act
passed in 1764 imposing duties on the sugar plantations. The
revenue was devoted to the protection of their trade.</p>

<p>The Quebec revenue act of 1774<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> was the other case. This act
imposed duties on rum, brandy, and other liquors coming into the
province, and employed the proceeds for the establishment of a
fund to aid in defraying the charges of the administration of justice
and of the civil government in the province of Quebec. It was
clear, then, that the acts of 1778 and 1791 contained no new
principle, but were simply declaratory of the steady policy of the
British government as disclosed by a review of its earlier practice;
and everything combined to satisfy the committee that the legislature
of the mother country never contemplated the raising of a
tax by inland postage in the colony of Upper Canada.</p>

<p>The committee concluded by submitting for the acceptance of
the house a resolution to the effect that the present system of public
posts for the conveyance of letters within the province had grown
into use without the sanction of law, and that a bill should be introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
establishing public posts and fixing the rates of postage on
letters and packets for the purpose of raising a permanent revenue,
applicable solely to the improvement of the roads throughout the
province.</p>

<p>The proposition of the assembly was thoroughly conservative.
It was simply that the profits from the post office should be devoted
to improving the means by which the post office was carried on.
Settlements were springing up in all parts of the province which
reason and policy made it necessary to connect with the more
central districts, and it was only proper that the profits arising
from the system should be used for improving and extending it.</p>

<p>At this period and for a long time afterwards the roads throughout
the province were in a wretched condition. One of the
principal mail contractors informed a committee of the house in
1829, that all the main roads in the province were very bad, and
that those in the neighbourhood of York were bringing discredit
on the inhabitants. The deputy postmaster general informed the
same committee that he had just been advised that the contractors
on the road from Montreal to Niagara had to swim their
horses over some of the rivers on the route, the bridges having
been carried away.</p>

<p>Peregrine Maitland, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada,
forwarded the report of the committee of 1821 to the colonial
office, with a letter in which he explained that what the legislature
desired was to have the control of the provincial posts vested in
them, or at least to have a deputy postmaster general for Upper
Canada. With the latter request he fully sympathised, as he was
convinced that a deputy postmaster general residing in Quebec
could not possibly appreciate the requirements of the rapidly
rising communities, situated so far from his headquarters.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor shared the opinion of the legislature
that it was contrary to the acts of 1778 and 1791 to send remittances
from Canada to England, but he did not believe that the legislature
would have concerned themselves with the subject, if the
post office authorities had provided a satisfactory service.</p>

<p>At the general post office in London the report was turned
over to the solicitor with directions to prepare a case for submission
to the law officers of the crown. The law officers were requested
to give their opinion as to whether the postmaster general of the
United Kingdom had the right to control and manage the internal
posts in the provinces of North America, and, if so, whether the
proceeds derived from the inland conveyance of letters in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
America ought to be paid into the exchequer of the United Kingdom
or whether they ought to be applied to the use of the province
from which they were taken.</p>

<p>But the case as prepared did not reach the law officers. The
postmaster general had the good sense to see that his case was
precarious, and he did not care to risk an adverse decision.</p>

<p>Freeling, accordingly, wrote to Maitland,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> admitting that the
postal transactions of Upper and Lower Canada together showed
a small surplus, but he inclined to the view that the share of Upper
Canada in the surplus must be very small. A number of post
offices had been opened in Upper Canada and the impression in
the general post office was that they were unprofitable.</p>

<p>If, as Maitland had intimated, the wishes of Upper Canada
would be satisfied by the appointment of a separate deputy
postmaster general for Upper Canada, the postmaster general,
Freeling informed the governor, would make no difficulty on the
point, but would naturally select for the position one of the more
experienced officers such as the postmaster of York or of Kingston.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while the report of 1821 was being discussed
by the secretary of the post office and the lieutenant governor,
the members of the assembly were endeavouring to procure further
information to strengthen the position they had taken. They
desired to learn definitely the amount which was sent to London
as postal revenue. The postmaster of York could tell them little
beyond the transactions of his own office, but the contribution
from that office made it clear that the revenue from the whole
province must be considerable.</p>

<p>No information could be obtained by direct inquiry of the
deputy postmaster general, but it was thought that the post office
would not refuse to answer a question on the subject asked by a
member of parliament.</p>

<p>A question was accordingly put in the house of commons in
1822, but Freeling informed the representative of the post office<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
in the house of commons that the information should not be given,
as the provinces were manifesting a disposition to interfere with
the internal posts, and to appropriate their revenues to their own
purposes, instead of allowing them to flow into the exchequer
of the United Kingdom. The maintenance of the packet service,
he declared to be of the greatest political importance, as ensuring
despatches against passing through foreign hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>The course pursued by the post office under the influence of
Freeling was in no way creditable to it. At a time when it was
making grudging admissions that there was a small profit from
the Canadian post offices, there was being sent over to London
from the two provinces a sum exceeding £6000 a year, an amount
which, wisely spent, would have been a considerable contribution
to the road fund of the provinces.</p>

<p>The packet, the importance of which Freeling emphasized,
was scarcely of any utility to the people of the Canadas. The
service by the packets was so slow and expensive that it was
not employed at all for commercial or social correspondence,
the merchants in London and Liverpool using exclusively the
lines of sailing vessels running between Liverpool and New York.
But Freeling was obstinate and often disingenuous in maintaining
his view that it was proper that the surplus revenues from the
provincial post offices should be turned into the British exchequer.</p>

<p>The disinclination of the general post office to discuss the
question of the colonial post office was not likely to suppress the
subject for long. The assembly of Upper Canada had too strong
a case. The political grievances from which the province was
suffering were bringing into the political life of Upper Canada
a group of men to voice the general dissatisfaction with the
state of affairs, and so undeniable an abuse could not remain
unexploited.</p>

<p>The house, which adopted the resolution of 1821, was on the
whole favourable to the lieutenant governor and his advisers.
The succeeding house, which was elected in 1825, contained a
majority opposed to the government. This fact did not, however,
lead to the overthrow of the lieutenant governor's advisers. They
were his own choice and were in no sense responsible to the house.
It was not until sixteen years later that responsible government,
as now understood, was established in Canada.</p>

<p>The turn of affairs in 1825, which placed the control of the house
in the hands of the opponents of the government had its effect
on the attitude of the parties towards the provincial post office.
In 1821, the lieutenant governor cordially supported the views
of the house, and did what he could to make them prevail with the
postmaster general. In 1825, when the post office grievance was
brought up for discussion, the lieutenant governor's party upheld
the position taken by the postmaster general in England.</p>

<p>The consequence was that, for the opposition, the post office
was but one more of the many matters calling for redress, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
for the government party it was another element in the burden
which they had to sustain in their resistance to reform.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1825, William Lyon Mackenzie presented a
petition to the house of assembly to have the affairs of the post
office investigated. Mackenzie, who had come to Upper Canada
in 1820, was engaged in business until 1824, when, impressed with
the various political abuses from which the country was suffering,
he abandoned what had every appearance of a successful career,
and gave himself to agitation. He established a newspaper&mdash;<i>The
Colonial Advocate</i>&mdash;in 1824, and in 1828 secured a seat in the
house of assembly. These vehicles of publicity he employed in
ceaseless attacks on the governing clique, which from the intimacy
of the ties binding its members together was known as the Family
Compact, and became the principal actor in the abortive rebellion
of 1837. The post office as then managed incurred his unremitting
hostility.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed having as chairman Captain John
Matthews, who represented the county of Middlesex along with
Dr. Rolph, subsequently one of the leaders of rebellion in 1837.
Matthews was a retired army officer, who entertained advanced
political views, which were irritating to the lieutenant governor.
He was later on made to feel the lieutenant governor's resentment
for his opposition. As chairman of the committee Matthews
reported on the 9th of March, 1825,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> that it was in evidence that
there were abuses which would be remedied, if the post offices
in the province were, as they should be, under the control and
supervision of the legislature.</p>

<p>The committee found that there were many populous districts,
in which post offices were much required; that many postmasters
performed their duties indifferently, letters and newspapers being
opened and read before being delivered; and that complaints to
the deputy postmaster general had no appreciable effect. The
mail bags, the committee also discovered, were often filled with
goods, having nothing to do with the post office, to the injury of
contractors as well as of the post office revenues.</p>

<p>Editors of newspapers, it was also ascertained, suffered from
the hardship of having to pay the postage on their newspapers in
advance, and the committee recommended that the postage on
newspapers should be collected as the postage on letters was,
from those who received the newspapers. Letters on public
business should, in the opinion of the committee, be carried free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of postage; and the surplus revenue should be expended on the
public roads and bridges which were in a deplorable state.</p>

<p>The final conclusion of the committee was that the provincial
legislature should take on itself the entire management of the
post office, even though this should involve some temporary
expense. It was not anticipated that such would be the case,
but in any event the deficits would be of short duration.</p>

<p>In the following session&mdash;1826&mdash;the post office was again
discussed. This time the discussion was on a motion of Charles
Fothergill to take into consideration the state of the province.
Fothergill was king's printer, and had been postmaster of Port
Hope. He was dismissed from the post office for his criticism of the
administration, and was soon to be deprived of the office of king's
printer, on account of his advocacy of measures distasteful to the
lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Fothergill in his attack on the post office,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> had the advantages
of experience, and of some inside knowledge. Arguing from the
revenue of Port Hope, he declared his belief that the sum remitted
to London each year could not be less than £10,000, and that the
business was increasing so rapidly that in a few years the surplus
revenue from the post office would pay the whole expenses of civil
government in the province.</p>

<p>Some of the postmasters, Fothergill complained, acted with much
insolence towards those not in favour with the government. Their
newspapers were thrown about. Their letters were handed to them
open. The mails were often opened in public bar rooms. Sutherland,
the deputy postmaster general, had admitted to Fothergill that he
was ignorant of the geography of the province, which was a strong
reason for the appointment of a resident deputy postmaster general.
Fothergill's great objection to the existing arrangements was that
they were unconstitutional, and that the tax on newspapers was
so oppressive as to check their circulation. To test the feeling of
the house Fothergill offered a resolution declaring that the acts
of 1778 and 1791 were part of the constitution of the province.</p>

<p>John Beverly Robinson, the attorney general, traversed
Fothergill's statements, and desired the house to take satisfaction
from the fact that all the other colonies sent their surplus post
office revenues to the general post office, without remonstrance.
He did not believe that any large sum was sent from Canada.
Indeed, Freeling told him (what was quite untrue) that the
Canadian post office was a burden on the home department.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Fothergill was supported by Rolph, and also by Bidwell, one
of the leaders of the opposition, and afterwards speaker of the
house. Rolph recalled that the postmasters who had appeared
before the committee testified that the provincial post office was
a remunerative institution. He was satisfied that it could not be
otherwise, as he had learned by experience that a post office,
however much required, would not be opened until the deputy
postmaster general was guaranteed against any loss which might
arise. But even if the post office could be shown to be unproductive,
he would propose to take it off the hands of the mother
country while it was a burden to her, and not to wait until it began
to be profitable.</p>

<p>Rolph moved an address to the king affirming that the present
system was being carried on contrary to the act of 1791, an act
which was held by the house to be a fundamental part of the
constitution of the province; that a well-regulated post office,
responsible to the constituted authorities of the province, and
extended in the number of its establishments would tend to
correct and prevent abuses which were found to exist under the
present system, would facilitate commercial intercourse, promote
the diffusion of knowledge and would eventually become an
important branch of the provincial revenue. The assembly
therefore begged, with many expressions of loyalty and gratitude,
that the control and emoluments of the post office so far as they
concerned the province might be conceded to them. There was
some opposition to Rolph's motion. Eventually the address was
adopted by a vote of nineteen to five.</p>

<p>The address, which it will be recalled had originated with the
opposition, was laid before the colonial office under very different
circumstances from those attending the report of 1821. On that
occasion, the memorial was brought to the foot of the throne with
the good wishes of both the government and the legislature. It
was accompanied by a letter from the lieutenant governor, commending
it to the favourable consideration of the home authorities.</p>

<p>The address of 1826 was also accompanied by a letter<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> from
the lieutenant governor, but so far from commending it, the
purpose of the letter was to suggest an answer confuting the
arguments of the assembly. Dealing first with the allegation of
the assembly that the postage charges were a tax, and as such
repugnant to the act of 1778, Maitland recalled Franklin's contention
before the British house of commons in 1765, that postage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
duty was not a tax, but rather a consideration for a service performed,
and exacted only from those who chose to avail themselves
of that service.</p>

<p>Assuming, as the governor did, that the revolted colonies
generally acquiesced in the justice of Franklin's view, while
objecting to other duties as unconstitutional, he could not see on
what valid grounds the legislature rested its case. This reasoning
is directly the opposite of the view expressed by the lieutenant
governor in 1821. He then gave it as his opinion that the acts
of 1778 and 1791 made it illegal for the Canadian post office to
make remittances to London of surplus revenue, but that the
matter would not have been noticed in the province, if a satisfactory
service had been given by the deputy postmaster general.</p>

<p>Indeed, Maitland left no doubt that his real opinion was
unchanged, for he went on to intimate that he would not depend
upon Franklin's argument, if it could be shown that there was
any considerable surplus from the postal operations in Upper
Canada. The lieutenant governor enjoyed his little excursions
among the statutes, however, and although the postmaster general
had the benefit of the advice of the law officers of the crown, Sir
Peregrine did not scruple to take on himself the rôle of legal
adviser of the general post office.</p>

<p>Even if the duties were declared to be a tax within the meaning
of the act of 1778, since the duties were collected under the amendment
of 1765 to the act of 1710 which was anterior to the act of
1778, Maitland argued that it was questionable whether their
collection could be regarded as a violation of the act of 1778. But
there was one person to whom this gratuitous argument carried
no conviction, and that was the propounder of it himself. He
would still hark back to his underlying idea, and intimated his
persuasion that the British government had no desire to raise a
revenue from the colonies through the post office, and suggested
that if it could be shown that the post office yielded a large revenue
after paying the charges, the government would be prepared to
reduce the rates or to place the surplus at the disposal of the
colony.</p>

<p>Although the assembly stated that it would be desirable in the
interests of the province to have the post office under the control
of its legislature, the lieutenant governor believed that the preponderance
of the better opinion, whether in or out of the assembly,
would be found opposed to that proposition. It would be impossible
to carry on an independent system in an inland province,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and the attempt to do so would involve the colony in heavy
expenditure. The lieutenant governor discredited entirely the
allegations that there were abuses in the service, and he had much
reason for thinking that Sutherland, the deputy postmaster general,
discharged his duties to the general satisfaction of the public.</p>

<p>Maitland's letter, which bears all the marks of having been
written by the attorney general, Beverly Robinson, is a capital
illustration of the vicious circle of deception sometimes practised
by persons having a common purpose with reference to a scheme.
The official class in York, as well as the secretary of the general
post office, desired to defeat the wishes of the house of assembly
respecting the post office, the family compact group, because any
victory gained by the house threatened the privileges enjoyed
by that class; Freeling, secretary of the post office, because it
would diminish the revenues of which he was a most zealous
guardian.</p>

<p>Freeling told the attorney general that the Canadian post office
was a burden on the revenues of the general post office, and the
attorney general, accepting this statement, told the secretary that
such being the case, the statutes on which the house of assembly
relied were not applicable. The secretary's statement was demonstrably
incorrect, but it furnished the foundation for the opinion
which he desired, that the law did not require, nor did expediency
suggest, the transfer to the Upper Canadian legislature of the
control of the post office in that province.</p>

<p>Robinson wrote to Freeling supporting the views of the lieutenant
governor; and at the same time Freeling received a letter
from Markland, a member of the executive and legislative council
of Upper Canada, protesting against the attempt on the part of
the assembly to interfere with the post office as the assumption of
a right to which they had not the least pretension. The best-intentioned
and the best-informed people in the province were
against such interference.</p>

<p>By way of parrying the demand of the assembly for control
over the post office, Markland suggested that it would be well to
appoint a post office superintendent for the upper province. Upper
Canada was entirely distinct from Lower Canada in all matters of
government. The post office alone was subject to the control of
a person, outside of the province, who never visited it. The people
of Upper Canada were, he declared, energetic and enterprising,
and immigration was coming in on a full tide. Freeling considered
this an important letter, and laid it before the postmaster general.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The agitation in Upper Canada aroused a flutter of interest
in London. When newspaper reports of the discussions in the
house of assembly in December 1825, reached St. Martins-le-Grand,
they fell under the notice of the postmaster general, who was moved
to ask Freeling what it all meant. Freeling replied that the
accounts related to great disputes in Canada as to the application
of the rates of postage levied in that country, whether the rates
should not be devoted to local purposes. At that time, Freeling
stated, the rates formed part of the consolidated fund.</p>

<p>The colonial office and the treasury also made inquiries. The
colonial office was informed that the revenues of Upper and
Lower Canada were blended, and that for seven years previous
there had been a surplus from the two provinces which amounted
on the average to £5790 a year.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> It was also pointed out that the
estimated cost of the packet service was £10,000 a year.</p>

<p>Robinson,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> the chancellor of the exchequer, with whom Freeling
had an interview in October 1826,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> did not fall in with Freeling's
views quite as readily as the others had done. He expressed the
opinion that Canada's contention was in the main sound. The
net revenue from the Canadian post office ought in fairness to be
applied to colonial purposes, not in the mode or on the principle
put forward by the assembly, but under the direction of the home
government. It should be in the nature of a civil list.</p>

<p>Freeling was alarmed at the chancellor's utterances, and
reminded him that what was granted to Canada could not be
withheld from Jamaica. The chancellor admitted this to be the
case. Freeling insisted that there could be no doubt as to the
legality of the present practice, though he confessed that the law
officers gave no opinion on the case prepared in 1822. Indeed, it
had not been submitted to them, as Lord Chichester, the postmaster
general, had an invincible reluctance to taking their opinion,
and would not do so unless positively instructed by the government.</p>

<p>Then there were the packets. Freeling could not let the opportunity
pass of mentioning Canada's obligations with respect to the
packet service. He did not, however, endeavour to impose on the
chancellor of the exchequer his view that the cost of this service
should be set against Canada's post office surplus. In his memorandum
of the interview, Freeling merely notes that the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
between them inclined to the view that as the packets were maintained
for the benefit of Canada as well as of Nova Scotia, some part
of the expense should be borne by Canada.</p>

<p>Up to this point, the agitation against the post office was
confined to Upper Canada, which indeed was the more aggressive
province during the whole course of the dispute. In 1827, however,
the legislative assembly of Lower Canada took a hand in
the controversy, contributing a strictly legal and even technical
memorandum embodying an argument in favour of its contention
that the colonies should participate with the United Kingdom in
the profits of the general post office.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The memorandum pointed out that the act of Queen Anne
established a general post office for, and throughout Great Britain
and Ireland, the colonies and plantations in North America and
the West Indies, and all other of Her Majesty's dominions and
territories; and that of the duties arising by virtue of this act,
£700 a week were to be paid into the exchequer for public purposes
in Great Britain. Certain annuities and encumbrances charged
on the postal revenues by earlier acts, were continued by the act of
Queen Anne. When these charges amounting to £111,461 17<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>,
and the £700 a week already mentioned were satisfied, one-third of
the remaining surplus was reserved to the disposal of parliament
"for the use of the public."</p>

<p>The house of assembly argued that this act, which by later acts
was declared to be in force in Canada, applied to the people of
England, Ireland and colonies of North America and in the West
Indies. The word "public," therefore, being used without
limitation, or qualification, could not signify exclusively the
people of Great Britain and Ireland, or of the colonies. On the
contrary, being equally applicable to all who were within the
purview of the act, it designated the people of all the dominions
of the crown in which the postal revenue was to be levied. The
statute thus carried on the face of it a parliamentary declaration
that the colonies were entitled to a share of the post office revenues,
and it enacted, by implication, that the amount of the share should
be determined by parliament at some future period.</p>

<p>Here followed a novel and ingenious application of the statute
of 1778, which was enacted for the purpose of conciliating the
colonies by conceding the point at issue between them and the
mother country.</p>

<p>The assembly stated that by this act it was declared that, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the peace and welfare of His Majesty's dominions, the net produce
of all duties, which after the passing of that act were imposed by
parliament upon the colonies, should be applied to the use of the
colony in which it is levied. Unlike the assembly of Upper
Canada, the assembly of Lower Canada did not maintain that the
act of Queen Anne was annulled by the act of 1778.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the British post office rested its
claim to collect the colonial postages on Queen Anne's act with
its amendments, while the Upper Canada assembly asserted that
the act of 1778, which was made part of the constitutional act of
1791, deprived the British government of any right it formerly
had to impose a tax on the colonies.</p>

<p>The Lower Canadian house of assembly made another use of the
act of 1778. It submitted that, so far as postal revenues were
concerned, it was the complement of the act of Queen Anne.
The earlier act, in the view of the assembly, left the amounts of
the shares of the postal revenues to which the colonies were entitled,
to be determined by a future act of parliament, and the act
of 1778 had this effect, if not in the letter, at least in its spirit;
and consequently Lower Canada, as one of the colonies had a fair
and equitable claim to the net produce of the post office revenue
levied within the province, after deducting the expenses of the post
office established therein.</p>

<p>Shortly before the house of assembly at York took into its
consideration the question of the legality of the postal system
in operation in Upper Canada, the home authorities were discussing
a matter, which was a source of much embarrassment to
the deputy postmaster general. The steamboats, which had been
running since 1809, between Montreal and Quebec, had so far
improved that they outdistanced the mail couriers, who travelled
on the shore of the river, and a great many letters were carried
between the two towns by the steamers.</p>

<p>The deputy postmaster general made provision for the conveyance
of letters by steamers, by placing official letter boxes on
the boats. He allowed the captains twopence for each letter they
carried, and charged the public the regular postage rates. But
the public paid little attention to the letter boxes. They simply
threw their letters on a table in the cabin, and when the steamer
reached its destination, those expecting letters sent down to the
landing and got them, paying a small gratuity to the captain.</p>

<p>Moreover, in cases where the letters had been deposited in the
letter boxes on the steamer, and were delivered by the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
at the post office, many of the people to whom the letters were
addressed refused to pay the same charges as if the letters were
conveyed by land, alleging that such charges were illegal.</p>

<p>The deputy postmaster general laid the facts before his superiors
in England in 1819, asking for some document of an authoritative
character, which, when published, would put a stop to the illegal
practices. The solicitor of the post office to whom the matter was
referred had no doubt that the acts complained of were illegal,
and would render the offenders liable to penalties, if the practice
were carried on in England, but he could not be sure that penalties
for the infraction of the post office act could be recovered in Canada.</p>

<p>Freeling, the secretary, thereupon made a suggestion<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> which
must have caused him some pain. The right of the post office to
protect its monopoly was quite clear, and the natural course of the
postmaster general would be to direct his deputy in Canada to
enforce the law. But as the legislatures had in several instances
manifested an inclination to interfere with the internal posts, he
recommended that, instead of taking proceedings to protect His
Majesty's revenues, and, as he says, to enable them to continue
to flow into the exchequer of the United Kingdom, the postmaster
general should state the circumstances to the colonial secretary,
and request his opinion before instructions were sent out to the
deputy postmaster general.</p>

<p>Bathurst, the colonial secretary, fully concurred in the view
of the postmaster general that the subject was one of great delicacy,
and wrote to the governor general, Lord Dalhousie, setting forth
the facts and stating that under ordinary circumstances he would
have had no difficulty in recommending a prosecution.</p>

<p>In view of the attention which the house of assembly had been
giving to the revenues of the colonial post office, and of the doubt
which had been suggested as to the right of Great Britain to receive
those revenues, the colonial secretary thought it possible that the
enforcement of those rights at that time might embarrass the
governor general by giving the assembly an additional ground for
contention with the mother country. He, therefore, had given
directions that the deputy postmaster general should communicate
with the governor general on the subject, and should not institute
proceedings without the full concurrence of the latter.</p>

<p>The deputy postmaster general was instructed in this sense in
September 1820, and matters remained in abeyance until 1826,
when the deputy postmaster general, presumably with the concurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of the governor general requested the opinion of the
attorney general of Lower Canada on the subject. The attorney
general, James Stuart (afterwards Sir James) advised that the right
of the post office was clear, and he conceived that there should
be no difficulty in recovering pecuniary penalties for the infringement
of the postmaster general's privilege.</p>

<p>But no action was taken on this opinion. The relations between
the provincial governors and the assemblies were becoming more
strained as time went on, and the governor general had no desire
to augment the grievances of the assemblies by introducing irritating
matters, in which the right of the home government might
with reason be held to be disputable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Thomas Allen Stayner deputy postmaster general&mdash;Restrictions of general
post office relaxed&mdash;Grievances of newspaper publishers&mdash;Opinion of law
officers of the crown that postmaster general's stand is untenable&mdash;Consequences.</p></div>


<p>Owing to failing health, Sutherland retired from the service in
1827. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Thomas Allen Stayner,
the last of the deputies of the postmaster general of England,
and in many respects the most notable. Stayner was brought
up in the post office, and at the time of his appointment to the
position of deputy postmaster general he was in charge of the
Quebec post office.</p>

<p>A man of unusual ability, Stayner gained the confidence of
his superiors in England, to a degree at no time enjoyed by his
predecessors. What was equally important, he managed to keep
on good terms with the governments of the two provinces.</p>

<p>When the houses of assembly in Upper and Lower Canada
denounced the post office as inefficient and unconstitutional, and
proposed to take the management of it into their own hands, the
governors and legislative councils in the two provinces took the
side of Stayner, and while they urged upon him and the postmaster
general the expediency of meeting the reasonable demands of the
assemblies, they set their faces steadily against any revolutionary
propositions respecting the control of the department.</p>

<p>This attitude was in a measure due to a change in the policy
of the postmaster general and his advisers in England. The
earlier deputies were held by so tight a rein, and their suggestions
and recommendations so little regarded, that they occupied a rôle
scarcely more important than that of being the hands and voice
of a department, which, unpopular at home on account of its
illiberality, aroused general discontent in Canada by adding to
its administrative vices, an entire ignorance of the situation with
which it had to deal.</p>

<p>At the outset of his administration Stayner's powers were as
much restricted as were those of the deputies who preceded him.
A few months after his appointment, he opened a post office at
Guelph. He assured the postmaster general that he had not done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
so until he had satisfied himself that the prospective revenue
would more than meet the expense. But he did not escape a
warning and an intimation that the departmental approval would
depend on the financial results.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Stayner established an additional courier
on the route between St. John and St. Andrews in New Brunswick,
the point at which the mails between the Maritime provinces and
the United States were exchanged. This action, though most
desirable in the public interest, brought down upon him a rebuke,
and a reminder that the postmaster general's sanction must be
obtained in all possible cases, before lines of communication were
opened which were attended with expense.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the country were making a continuance
of this repressive course impossible. Settlements were springing
up too rapidly, and the demands for postal facilities were becoming
too insistent to leave it possible to delay these demands until
formal sanction was obtained from England. In November 1829,
Stayner informed the postmaster general that, in Upper Canada, the
lieutenant governor, the legislature, the merchants, and indeed the
whole population, were calling for increased postal accommodation.</p>

<p>In the United States, Stayner pointed out, almost every town
and village had a daily mail, and this excited discontent with the
comparative infrequency of the Canadian service. He suggested
that he be allowed to expand the service, and to increase the
frequency of the courier's trips, wherever he was convinced that
the ensuing augmentation of correspondence would more than meet
the additional expense.</p>

<p>Stayner had been so fortunate as to impress the postmaster
general with the fact that a very considerable discretion might
safely be left with him. Besides this, the postmaster general
was under a growing sense of the insecurity of the legal foundations
of the post office in the colonies. To Stayner's gratification he
received a letter from the postmaster general<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> enjoining him to
make it his study to extend the system of communication in all
directions where the increase of population and the formation of
new towns and settlements seemed to justify it.</p>

<p>This was a wise step. It gave the department a representative,
zealous in its interests, as intimately acquainted with local
conditions as the assemblies themselves, and thoroughly competent
to undertake the responsibility devolving upon him.</p>

<p>Stayner's commission placed New Brunswick as well as Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and Lower Canada, under his charge. But before the close of
1828 the service in New Brunswick was transferred to the control
of the deputy postmaster general for Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> This change
was made at the instance of the deputy of Nova Scotia, who,
being in England at the time, explained to the postmaster general
how much more closely New Brunswick was associated with Nova
Scotia than with Quebec, and pointed out that orders from home
affecting New Brunswick and requiring immediate attention were
delayed in that they had to pass from Halifax through New
Brunswick, and then return to New Brunswick. All the other
branches of the imperial service in New Brunswick had their
local headquarters in Halifax.</p>

<p>At the time Stayner was placed in charge of the postal service
in the Canadas, the system of communication was still simple
enough to be described in a few lines. There was a trunk line from
Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Niagara and Amherstburg on the
western boundaries of Upper Canada. The distances were to
Niagara, one thousand three hundred and fifty-six miles, and to
Amherstburg, one thousand five hundred and sixteen miles.</p>

<p>The frequency of the trips made by the mail couriers over the
several stretches of this long route varied considerably. Between
Halifax and Quebec, a courier travelled each way weekly. The
section between Quebec and Montreal, the most populous in the
country, was covered by couriers, who passed five times each way
weekly between the two cities.</p>

<p>From Montreal westward along the shores of the St. Lawrence
and lake Ontario to Niagara and Amherstburg, there were semi-weekly
trips. Running out from this trunk line there were six
cross routes, four in Lower Canada, and two in Upper Canada.
Two of these left the trunk line at Three Rivers&mdash;one running to
Sorel, by way of Nicolet, with semi-weekly mails; and the other
to Sherbrooke, Stanstead and other places in the eastern townships.
There was a weekly service over this route.</p>

<p>Mails were carried up the Ottawa river from Montreal as far
as Hull, and southward to St. Johns; in both cases twice weekly.
In Upper Canada, the only cross routes were one from Cornwall
to Hawkesbury, with weekly mails, and another from Brockville
to Perth, with mails twice a week. From Perth there was a weekly
courier to Richmond.</p>

<p>The two principal points of connection with the United States
were at St. Johns, south of Montreal, and Queenston on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Niagara river. As early as 1828, the United States post office
had a daily service by steamer on lake Champlain, which ran as
far northward as St. Johns. In 1831, Stayner made a notable
improvement in the mail service from Montreal to Niagara, increasing
the frequency of the trips to five each week, and reducing the
time of conveyance between the two points to six days.</p>

<p>The appointment of Stayner in no way diminished the energy
with which the houses of assembly pursued their campaign against
the administration of the post office. In March 1828, the assembly
in Upper Canada named a committee consisting of Fothergill,
Ingersoll, Matthews and Beardsley, to inquire into the state of
the post office. Their report, which was made in 1829, did not
disclose any new facts. Indeed, it would not seem that the
assemblies, in the series of inquiries, which were ordered from
year to year, thought so much of obtaining new light on the
question as of keeping the public alive to the grievances, which
they were made to appear to suffer.</p>

<p>The committee of 1829, after affirming the illegality of the
existing system and declaring that the surplus revenue which was
sent annually to Great Britain, was the result of starving the
service, recommended the establishment of a provincial post office,
subject to the legislatures. Post routes should be opened to every
court house, and the charges on letters and newspapers conveyed
by steamboats should not exceed twopence and one farthing each
respectively.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor, Sir John Colborne, though friendly
to Stayner, and appreciative of his efforts to meet the demands of
the public in Upper Canada, was not altogether satisfied with the
system. He maintained that it was impossible for Stayner from
his headquarters in Quebec to follow the rapid changes
in the conditions of settlement in Upper Canada, and was of
opinion that the remedy for the existing shortcomings of the post
office in that province was to appoint an official of a rank equal,
or nearly so, to that held by Stayner, and station him in Toronto.</p>

<p>Colborne, in communicating the view to the colonial office,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
also requested that arrangements should be made for a regular
interchange of correspondence between Upper Canada and Great
Britain, by way of New York.</p>

<p>Freeling, the secretary of the post office, was quite willing to
meet the views of the lieutenant governor, but was inclined to
the view that the people on both sides of the Atlantic had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
settled the question their own way. He explained that there was
a plan in full operation by which the correspondence between
Liverpool and Upper Canada was conveyed across the ocean
independently of the post office at twopence a letter, and that
there was little likelihood that the public would seek the aid of the
post office to have this conveyance done for them, and thereby
become subject to charges four times as great.</p>

<p>The people of Liverpool, who had the largest correspondence
with the United States, Freeling reminded Colborne, scarcely sent
one letter per week by post, though thousands were sent outside
the post office, by the same vessels as carried the mails for the post
office. As for the appointment of a resident deputy in Upper
Canada, Freeling thought there would be no objection to such
an arrangement.</p>

<p>In this opinion Stayner by no means concurred. He could
see no good reason for such an appointment. The postmaster
general was more impressed with the representations on behalf
of the province than Freeling thought desirable. Freeling reminded
the postmaster general that his powers might not be equal to his
desires. He observed that in the lieutenant governor's letter, a
question was involved as to whether, and if so, to what extent,
the revenues of the post office could be devoted to the general
improvement of communications for the public advantage, and he
conceived that this was a point of view from which the postmaster
general was not empowered to regard the subject.</p>

<p>But the forces were gathering for an attack on the post office,
which promised to be much more formidable than any which had
preceded it. Until that time, the assailants of the system had
been confined to what the official clique regarded as the radicals
and republicans and grievance-mongers. In the houses of
assembly the grievances of which they complained became the
motive of highly effective speeches and resolutions, but the injuries
they alleged really hurt nobody.</p>

<p>The rates of postage on letters were, according to present day
standards, exorbitant. But they were no higher than those
charged in England; and after all the post office was but little
used by the masses of the people. It is doubtful if the post office
were employed in 1830 any more freely than the telegraph is
to-day. In their contention that it was a violation of constitutional
guarantees to send the surplus post office revenue to England, the
assemblies were undoubtedly correct, but loyal people bear many
things of that kind easily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time, however, the question was taken up by a body to
whom the postage rates were a personal grievance, and who at
the same time possessed the means of successful agitation. In
the beginning of 1829, a number of newspaper publishers in Lower
Canada approached the governor general, Sir James Kempt,
with a request that they might be relieved of the payment of
postage on the newspapers which they sent to subscribers.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> They
did not ask that the postage be remitted altogether. All they
desired was that the postage should be collected from the subscribers
and not from themselves. They also suggested that the
charge might be fixed at one penny per copy.</p>

<p>Stayner declared that he had no power to enter into such an
arrangement. The publishers thereupon changed their request,
and asked that they might be put on the same footing as the
newspaper publishers in England stood, and be thus entirely
exempt from postage on their newspapers.</p>

<p>British publishers had enjoyed this concession since 1825, but
as they still had to pay a heavy excise duty on the paper they used,
they could not be regarded as free from public charges. In Canada
there was no stamp duty on paper. This difference between
their situation and that of their brethren in England was pointed
out to the publishers, but the explanation failed to satisfy.</p>

<p>One of the publishers, who had some inkling of the fact that the
newspaper postage did not go into the public revenue, but formed
part of the emoluments of the deputy postmaster general, observed
that with as much consistency a toll keeper might insist on farmers
paying high charges to him, because they paid no tithes.</p>

<p>With the publishers awake to the fact that they had something
to complain of, they made the most of their grievance. They
were experts in this line of exploitation. They found that the
newspaper charges, which they were convinced had no legal
sanction, had been steadily advancing for forty years past. In
1790, a shilling a year was all that was charged as postage for
each copy of a weekly newspaper. This rate was increased by
degrees to one shilling and threepence, one shilling and eightpence,
two shillings, two shillings and sixpence, until, in 1830, it had risen
to four shillings a year on weekly papers, and to five shillings for
papers published twice a week. The discontent of the publishers
was not lessened by the knowledge that in the Maritime provinces,
the yearly rate for weekly papers was two shillings and sixpence
for each copy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The agitation against the newspaper charges was set in motion
by Robert Armour, proprietor of the <i>Montreal Gazette</i>. It had
come to his knowledge that the sums collected from the publishers
did not appear in the accounts of the postmasters with the department,
and he suspected that in some way they were retained by
Stayner, though on this point he had no certain information.</p>

<p>After Armour learned that the rates had been subjected to a
continuous process of enhancement, he made diligent search for
any warrant that might exist for the successive advances or
indeed for the original charge. Finding none, he turned to the
authorities for information. It was he who led the deputation to
the governor general for relief in some form. When this step
failed, Armour demanded of the deputy postmaster general his
authority for the newspaper charges.</p>

<p>Getting no answer from that quarter, Armour endeavoured to
bring matters to an issue by refusing to pay the postage on the
copies of his paper which he posted in Montreal. The postmaster
declined to accept the papers without the postage, and Armour
appealed to the postmaster general in London. In due time the
reply from the department was received, and while it offered no
immediate relief, it put Armour in possession of some exclusive
information, which, as a newspaper man, he must have considered
valuable.</p>

<p>Freeling, the secretary, informed Armour that the postmaster
of Montreal had failed in his duty, in refusing to transmit the
newspapers simply because the postage was not paid. The
postmaster should have sent the newspapers forward, and since
the postage demanded by Stayner was not paid, it fell upon the
postmasters of the offices to which the papers were directed to
collect the postage, at the same rates as were charged on letters.</p>

<p>As each paper was under this ruling chargeable with the rate
which was due on four letters, it may well be imagined that no
publisher would offer to pay the post office for the distribution of
his papers by that means. On these conditions, the postage on
each copy sent from Montreal to any of the post offices on the
island of Montreal, to St. Johns or to the nearer settlements in
Upper Canada would be thirty-two cents. Each copy sent to
Three Rivers or to any points between sixty and one hundred
miles from Montreal would cost the subscribers forty-eight cents.</p>

<p>It is needless to pursue the charges into districts where the
copies were sent over one hundred miles. Freeling went on to
explain that, as the post office act had no provision for the conveyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of newspapers, the postmaster general, in order to accommodate
the publishers permitted the deputy postmaster general
to make private arrangements with them for the transmission of
their newspapers. By ancient and authorized custom, the deputy
postmaster general was allowed to treat the receipts from this
source as his own perquisite. This information with the comments
thereon greatly enlivened many issues of the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>Freeling was denounced as a sinecurist, who permitted impositions
in the colonies which he dared not make at home. Armour
announced that he would carry the matter into the legislature,
and, if necessary, into the courts. He had no desire to escape
the payment of postage. All he demanded was the establishment
of an equitable rate, placed on a legal basis. His idea was that
the postmasters who handled the newspapers should be paid from
five to ten per cent. of their cost. The rates charged by Stayner
amounted to from twenty to twenty-five per cent. of the subscription
price. Armour would resist Stayner's claim to be a sleeping
partner in his business, who, contributing neither capital nor
talent, dictated what his share of the revenue should be.</p>

<p>Armour could write well, and his onslaught caused Stayner
much uneasiness. In a letter to the postmaster general<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> he
attributed it to some neglect or indignity, which Armour fancied
he suffered at the hands of a former deputy postmaster general,
while, he stated, other newspapers were recognizing with gratitude
Stayner's efforts to satisfy the reasonable demands of the public.</p>

<p>Every side of Stayner's work was vigorously attacked in the
<i>Gazette</i>. Complaints were made of a lack of necessary mail routes,
and of an insufficiency of service on existing routes. It was
charged also that Stayner's attention was confined to the older
and more thickly settled districts, which yielded the largest
revenues. But, according to Stayner, Armour's silence could
have been purchased by a share of the official printing which
Stayner declined to give him. Whatever grounds Stayner had
for making the insinuation, there can be no question as to the
energy with which Armour bent himself to the task of exposing
the methods of the post office. When his papers were held in the
Montreal post office on account of his refusal to prepay the postage,
he entered actions for large amounts against Stayner.</p>

<p>These failed, as the courts declined to deal with the cases. He
then addressed himself to the legislature. In the beginning of
1831, Armour and a number of other publishers presented a petition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to the house of assembly of Lower Canada, setting forth the
high rates they had to pay as postage for the transmission of their
newspapers, and the impropriety of Stayner's practice in appropriating
the proceeds; and asking that they might be put on an
equal footing with the publishers in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The petition was handed over to a committee of the house,
who proceeded to investigate the facts. In this they were only
moderately successful, as the only person who was in a position
to give them the information they desired, declined to answer
the interrogatories put to him.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Stayner, in reply to inquiries as to the financial condition of
the post office and the disposition of the surplus revenues, pleaded
that he was employed by a branch of the imperial government,
which in none of its instructions had recognized the right of the
assembly to institute the inquiries being made. To answer the
questions put to him by the committee might lead to disclosures,
which would involve him with his superior officers until he had
received specific instructions from them on the point.</p>

<p>But though little was learned from Stayner, the committee
had obtained some useful information from inquiries made in the
British house of commons by Joseph Hume. It appeared that
the large sum of £36,000 had been received by the British treasury
as surplus revenue for the years 1825 and 1826.</p>

<p>Stayner endeavoured to lessen the importance of this fact by
declaring that more than half the amount was postage paid by
the army, which was not properly chargeable with postage at all.
The committee declined to accept this view; and while perfectly
friendly to Stayner, and admitting that he had effected some
considerable improvements, they were persuaded that the service
was far from being what the people had a right to expect.</p>

<p>Looking outwards from Quebec, the committee observed that
there was no postal service whatever in the counties of Montmorency
and Saguenay, which embraced the earliest settlements
in the country. On the south shore of the St. Lawrence, and
along the Etchemin and Chaudiere rivers, there was a wide stretch
of well-settled country entirely lacking the means of communication
with the capital, though but a short distance from it.</p>

<p>From Quebec eastward to the New Brunswick boundary
there were over 100,000 people, and the only postal accommodation
for this great extent of territory was afforded by seven
post offices lying along the line of the post route between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Quebec and Halifax. The peninsula of Gaspe, with a line of
fishing settlements all along the coast, had but two mails each year.</p>

<p>The committee regretted particularly the situation as regards
the conveyance of newspapers. The post office was under no
legal obligation to carry them except as letters, and yet there was
no other means available for their circulation. If the law had not
conferred on the post office a monopoly of carrying letters, the
publishers would have a resource. They might establish a
transportation system, and meet their expenses by carrying letters
as well as newspapers.</p>

<p>The secrecy with which the affairs of the post office were
surrounded was much deprecated by the committee, as giving
ground for speculation and suspicion that could not fail to do
harm to the institution. If, under the present system of imperial
control, an adequate service were rendered, there would have been
no just grounds for complaint.</p>

<p>But if the interests of the province were not regarded, the
people were entitled to object to their being limited to a means
of conveyance which did not meet their requirements, and to
assume that the revenue arising from the service was not properly
applied. The committee in conclusion expressed their confidence
in the good will of both the postmaster general and his deputy
in Canada, and their belief that their complaint had only to
be laid before the governor general to secure favourable
consideration.</p>

<p>Before concluding to withhold from the house of assembly,
the information it sought, Stayner with characteristic prudence
had enlisted the support of the governor general, who coincided
with him in his view as to the impropriety of his submitting to
the questioning of the house regarding the affairs of a branch of
the imperial service. When he laid the course he had pursued
before the postmaster general, Stayner also gained his approval
for the zeal and sagacity he had shown.</p>

<p>But Armour persisted in his attacks in the <i>Gazette</i>, and in the
two sessions which followed managed to alienate from Stayner a
large measure of the good will of the house of assembly. Stayner's
determination to withhold information from the assembly was a
source of irritation. The facts which had come to their knowledge
through questions in the house of commons at Westminster,
the ungracious admissions which the possession of these facts
enabled the house to extort from Stayner, and his specious and
unconvincing defence of his perquisites, all combined to change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the house from an attitude of friendliness to one of criticism and
even hostility.</p>

<p>The house no longer rested in the belief that, to obtain satisfaction,
all that was necessary was to lay their grievances before
the department. In 1832, it denounced the methods of the
department, and presented an address to the governor general
praying that the home government might place the post office
under the control of the legislature.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>In the session of 1833, the pertinacious Armour again appeared
before the assembly. He had no new facts to present, but managed
to sustain the interest of the house in the facts already before it.</p>

<p>The assembly on this occasion set forth its views at greater
length. In an address to the king,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> it represented that the post
office should not be a means of raising a revenue greater than
was needed to enable it to establish offices wherever they might
be required; that if the rates were higher than was necessary for
that purpose they should be lowered; and that any surplus
revenue should be at the disposition of the legislature for the
improvement of communications by post throughout the country;
also, that newspapers should pass through the post office in Lower
Canada, free of postage.</p>

<p>In the assembly in Upper Canada the post office was also
vigorously assailed. There was general agreement on the proposition
that the existing arrangements were not satisfactory, but on
the point of remedy opinions differed sharply. The reformers,
of whom Dr. Duncombe was the spokesman, adopting the argument
of the Baldwin committee of 1821, insisted that the post
office had no legal basis in Upper Canada.</p>

<p>Duncombe and his associates held that it was a violation of
the constitution to send any surplus revenue to Great Britain,
and that it was the obvious duty of the legislature to pass an act,
taking to itself the control of the provincial post office. They
believed that the revenues from the service would amply suffice
to cover all its expenses, but if it should turn out that such was
not the case, they were prepared to meet the deficiency from the
general revenues of the province.</p>

<p>The government party, on the other hand, always ready to
fight for things as they were, did not accept the argument of the
Baldwin committee. They held that the post office was an institution
necessary to commerce, and, as such, it was not placed
by the acts of 1778 and 1791 under the jurisdiction of the provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
legislature. They did not believe that the provincial post
office furnished a revenue sufficient to cover the expenses, but if
it should be shown that they were wrong, and that the post office
yielded a surplus, they were convinced that the imperial government
had no desire to retain the surplus for its own purposes.</p>

<p>Colborne, the lieutenant governor, was in general agreement
with the government party. But he believed that, having regard
to the great distances between Quebec, and the rapidly rising
settlements in the remoter parts of Upper Canada, an administrator,
having his headquarters at Quebec could never understand
the necessities of the new districts, and that it was indispensable
that there should be stationed at Toronto an officer with powers
nearly, if not quite, equal to those of the deputy postmaster
general at Quebec.</p>

<p>In the sessions of 1832 and 1833, the subject was warmly
debated.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The views of the reformers were presented by Duncombe
and Bidwell. They were opposed by the attorney general
(Henry John Boulton), the solicitor general (Christopher Hagerman),
and Burwell, who was postmaster at Port Burwell.</p>

<p>It was one of the complaints of the reformers that there were
in the house of assembly a number of postmasters who voted not
according to their own convictions, but according to the orders
of Stayner.</p>

<p>As the result of the discussion, it was resolved to present an
address to the king, asking that an annual statement of the
revenue and expenditure of the department be laid before the
legislature; that newspapers should be distributed throughout the
province free of postage; that the correspondence of the members
of the legislature should pass free during sessions; and finally,
that in the event of a surplus being obtained, the postage rates
should be reduced, or that the surplus should be devoted to the
improvement of the roads.</p>

<p>Stayner, in sending to the postmaster general, copies of the
addresses from Upper and Lower Canada, expressed his gratification
that the assemblies in both provinces appeared to have
dropped the idea of independent provincial establishments, and
gave it as his opinion that the legislatures would look for nothing
further than such reasonable modifications of existing laws and
regulations as the imperial government might determine.</p>

<p>That some changes were necessary Stayner was quite convinced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
The postage on newspapers, for instance, could not long
remain in its present position, as regards either the amount of
the charges or the mode in which the revenue therefrom was
disposed of. As for the request of the legislatures that newspapers
should be distributed by the post office free of charge, there seemed
no sound reason why this should be done. A moderate rate
should be fixed, and some arrangement made for the disposal of
the revenue from this source. The present plan aroused dissatisfaction,
and indeed the amount collected was fast becoming too
large to be appropriated in the existing manner.</p>

<p>The postmaster general expressed his satisfaction with Stayner's
report, and indeed it appeared at that moment to be of more than
usual consequence to him that the colonies should be well affected
towards the post office.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when the Baldwin report reached
England in 1821, the postmaster general was sufficiently impressed
with the cogency of the argument against the legal standing of
the British post office in the colonies, to call for the opinion of the
law officers upon it. When the case was prepared by the solicitor
for the post office, it was still more impressive, and the postmaster
general thought better of his desire to have a definite opinion
upon it, as it appeared more than probable that the opinion might
be against the post office. He accordingly directed that the
papers should be put away, and they lay undisturbed for eleven
years.</p>

<p>But the repeated remonstrances of the colonial assemblies,
joined to the rising dissatisfaction with the general political
conditions in Upper and Lower Canada, made it desirable to
remove any real grievances which might be found to exist in the
control and management of the postal system.</p>

<p>The first step taken in this direction was to ascertain whether
there was any foundation for the contention of the assemblies
that the whole system rested on an illegal basis, and that the
revenues collected by the post office in the colonies were taken in
violation of the fundamental principle governing the relations
between the mother country and the colonies.</p>

<p>The case was accordingly submitted to the attorney general
and the solicitor general in 1832; and on the 5th of November of
that year a decision was given, upholding the colonial contentions
on all points.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The questions upon which the opinions of the law officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
were required were (first) whether the power to establish posts,
and the exclusive right to the conveyance of letters given by the
acts of 1711 and 1765, had the force of law in the Canadas, and
(second) whether the postage received for the inland conveyance
of letters within those provinces ought to be paid into the exchequer
and applied as part of the revenue of the United Kingdom, or
whether it ought to be devoted to the use of the province in which
it is raised.</p>

<p>The law officers gave the case the attention its importance
called for. It appeared, they stated, to involve practical considerations
of the highest political importance, bringing directly into
question the principle of the declaratory act of 1778, respecting
internal taxation of the colonies by the mother country.</p>

<p>Their opinion was that the rates of internal postage could not
be considered as within the exception of duties imposed for the
regulation of commerce, but that if they could be so considered,
they would by the terms of that act be at the disposal
of the province, instead of constituting a part of the revenues
appropriated for the general purposes of the empire.</p>

<p>It had been contended, as a question of law, that since the
act of 1765, by which the colonial rates were finally determined,
was in operation at the time of the declaratory act of 1788, it had
not been annulled by the latter act, the language of which was,
not that rates then existing should be no longer levied, but that
after the passing of the act of 1778, no tax or duty should be
levied. But the law officers had no great confidence in the argument.
In their own words they were of opinion that "it would
not be safe to agitate the question as a question of law with the
colony, and if it could be so discussed, it would not succeed, and
that it could not be enforced."</p>

<p>The opinion of the law officers could not have been unexpected,
but it gave the postmaster general much concern. In a note
appended to the decision, he accepted the opinion of the law
officers as conclusive. The department, he said, was beaten off
its first position, and his view was that a plan should be drawn
up by which the post office should relinquish to the provinces any
surplus revenue after the expenses were paid, and permit an
account of the receipts and expenditures to be laid on the tables
of the legislatures. While forced to concede this much the postmaster
general was convinced that the appointment of the officers
of the department should remain with the crown. Otherwise he
foresaw the ruin of the colonies, so far as correspondence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
concerned; for the postmaster general and legislature of Upper
Canada would be at perpetual strife with the postmaster general
and legislature of Lower Canada. However, he concluded that
before taking any step in the matter he would consult Goderich,
the colonial secretary.</p>

<p>It was not until the following March that the postmaster general
saw Goderich respecting the post office. The interview was quite
satisfactory. The colonial secretary agreed to the propositions.
Legislation would be necessary, and to that end Stayner was called
to London to give his assistance.</p>

<p>At this time the government received assurances from an
unexpected source that the plan settled upon would be satisfactory
to the Canadian people. William Lyon Mackenzie, and
Denis Benjamin Viger, representing as they maintained, the body
of the public in the two provinces, visited England for the purpose
of laying before the government the grievances of the Canadian
people.</p>

<p>On reaching London, Mackenzie and Viger wrote to the secretary
of the post office, requesting an interview with the postmaster
general. The request was refused on the ground that the postmaster
general did not feel authorized to communicate with any
person but the colonial secretary on colonial matters. The
delegates then addressed themselves to Goderich, who cordially
invited them to lay their case before him.</p>

<p>Mackenzie, thus encouraged, prepared a statement, which,
though long and detailed, was studiously moderate in tone.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> On
all other points of colonial policy, Mackenzie declared, people
would be found to differ, but as regards the post office there was
absolute unanimity. There must be a change. Stayner himself
admitted that the arrangements were imperfect.</p>

<p>The colonial governments were in favour of separate establishments,
but Mackenzie was of Stayner's opinion that such would
be impracticable. His own belief was that the only feasible
scheme would be to bring all the colonies of British North America
under one deputy postmaster general, who should be responsible
to the postmaster general of England. Mackenzie apparently
would be quite satisfied to see the office of deputy postmaster
general vested in Stayner, whom he described as a persevering,
active officer.</p>

<p>The other suggestions of Mackenzie were in line with the more
conservative recommendations of the colonial assemblies. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
one subject, however, he expressed himself strongly. He said
the packet service between the Canadian provinces and the mother
country was so indifferent that it went far to convince Canadians
that Great Britain desired as little correspondence with Canada
as possible.</p>

<p>As an instance of the inferiority of the packet service, Mackenzie
told Goderich that he had shortly before received a letter by the
Halifax packet, which was sixty-five days on the way, and which
cost five shillings and fourpence-halfpenny for postage, and another
by way of New York, which was only thirty-four days in coming,
and cost only one shilling and fourpence-halfpenny. The announcement
of the arrival of the English mail by the Halifax packet was
scarcely heeded, whereas no sooner was it known that the Liverpool
mail had arrived from New York than the Montreal post
office was crowded. Mackenzie's statement on this point was
fully confirmed by Stayner on his arrival in London in June.</p>

<p>Stayner, when informed of the opinion of the law officers, was
not disposed to acquiesce in it as readily as the postmaster general
had done. Colonial lawyers, always more imperial and more
conservative than the Eldons and Lyndhursts in London, had
assured him that the necessity of imperial control of the colonial
post office was the strongest reason for believing that parliament
never intended to divest itself of the power by the act of 1778.
The conviction of the necessity of imperial control was held by all
persons qualified to have an opinion, and, Stayner declared, by
the legislatures themselves.</p>

<p>The firm belief of Stayner was that, if the imperial parliament
failed to legislate on the present critical situation then they must
give up all idea of ever having the question settled. The several
colonies could never be brought to concur in their views on this
or any other subject. They knew this, and did not ask to have
the matter submitted to their own legislation.</p>

<p>Stayner certainly overstated the reluctance of the legislatures
to deal with the question of the provincial post office. But, as
his opinion had the support of so ultra a radical as Mackenzie,
the postmaster general could not be blamed for accepting, and, as
far as possible, acting upon it.</p>

<p>There was, however, a difficulty. Indeed, the way back into
right courses seemed beset with difficulties. The postmaster
general was quite willing to furnish the legislatures with annual
statements of the revenue and expenditure, to leave with the
colonies all surplus revenues, and to satisfy all the reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
desires of the provinces. But by what steps should he proceed,
to legalize the course he proposed?</p>

<p>If the necessary legislation could be enacted by the imperial
parliament, all would be well. With a free hand, he would have
no trouble in satisfying all the interests concerned. But if the
bills had to originate with the provincial legislatures, the postmaster
general would despair of bringing the matter to a successful
conclusion, as he was convinced that the requisite action on the
part of the several provincial legislatures would never be taken.
The postmaster general again turned to the law officers. It was
essential that they be consulted on the question.</p>

<p>The points on which opinion was desired were two. The first
was whether, without any further authority of parliament, the
surplus of any postal revenue raised within the colonies under the
act of 1765, could be appropriated and applied under the direction
of the respective legislatures for the use of the province in which
such surplus might arise.</p>

<p>The second was whether it would be competent for the British
parliament to fix a new set of rates for the colonies, or whether
the acts of 1778 and 1791 made it necessary that the authority
for such rates should proceed from the respective colonial
legislatures.</p>

<p>Both of these questions were answered adversely to the hopes
of the postmaster general.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The law officers had no doubt that
the act of 1778 was applicable to the Canadas, and that, if objections
were raised in the provinces to the payment of postages fixed by
the British parliament, whether by the act of 1765 or by an act
to be thereafter passed, the legality of the charges could not be
maintained, nor could payment of them be enforced in the absence
of authority from the legislature of the province concerned.</p>

<p>The proper procedure to be followed, in the opinion of the
law officers, was for the British parliament to repeal the act of
1765, and leave it to the provinces to establish a new set of rates.
The law officers were aware of the difficulties which would arise,
if after the act of 1765 had been repealed, the colonial legislatures
failed to agree on a scheme of rates or on the necessary arrangements
for a uniform postal system throughout the provinces. In
such a case, there would be a period in which there would be not
even the semblance of legal authority for the postal service within
the colonies.</p>

<p>After a further interchange of correspondence between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
postmaster general and the law officers, it was decided to introduce
into the imperial parliament a bill repealing the act of 1765, but
making the operation of the bill contingent upon suitable legislation
being adopted by the legislatures of the several provinces.
In order to facilitate the passage of identical legislation by each
of the legislatures, a draft act was prepared by the solicitor of
the general post office, and a copy was sent to the lieutenant
governor in each of the provinces for submission to his legislature.</p>

<p>The act of the imperial parliament was passed and received
the king's assent on the 26th of March, 1834.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It contained but
two clauses. The first provided for the repeal of the imperial
act of 1765, so far as that act authorized the collection of postage
in the colonies, but stipulated that it should not become operative
until acceptable legislation had been adopted in the several
provinces, authorizing the collection of postage and making
suitable arrangements for a postal service throughout the provinces.</p>

<p>The second clause stipulated that, in the event of the revenues
from the colonial post offices exceeding the expenditures, the
surplus should no longer be sent to London to form part of the
revenues of the United Kingdom, but should be divided among
the several colonies in the proportion of their gross revenues.</p>

<p>The draft bill, prepared by the solicitor of the general post
office, provided for a complete postal system in each of the provinces.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Under this bill, the postmaster general at St. Martin's-le-Grand
was to be the head of each provincial system, and the
appointment of a deputy postmaster general in each province,
who should reside in the province and manage the system therein,
was to be in his hands.</p>

<p>The postage rates were to be the same in the several provinces;
and in the case of correspondence between the provinces, the
charge for postage was to be fixed in accordance with the entire
distance the articles were carried, without regard to provincial
boundary lines.</p>

<p>It will be seen that if the provincial legislatures adopted the
bills framed in London for them, there would be no change whatever
in the practical working of the colonial system. The postmaster
general in London would, as theretofore, control the arrangements,
and the charges were fixed, regardless of provincial boundaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
As the imperial act stipulated that any surplus which
should arise from the system should be distributed among the
colonies, so the proposed provincial bills provided for the contingency
of a deficit in its operations.</p>

<p>Each provincial bill empowered the postmaster general to
demand from the legislature the amount, which it was agreed that
the province should be held responsible for, to make up the deficit.
Upper and Lower Canada were to bind themselves to pay in such
a case up to £2000 from each province. Nova Scotia was to pay
up to £1200; New Brunswick up to £600; and Prince Edward
Island up to £200.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the adoption of the bills by the several
legislatures, the postmaster general appointed an accountant,
who should have general charge of the financial transactions of
all the colonies. He was to be established at Quebec. His
position in relation to the deputy postmaster general of Lower
Canada was somewhat peculiar. While, in general, he was
subordinate to the deputy postmaster general, in all matters
touching the accounts, he was independent of the deputy, and
responsible only to the postmaster general in London.</p>

<p>There were also appointed two travelling surveyors or inspectors
in the Canadas, one of whom was stationed at Quebec, and the
other at Toronto. Nothing could have been more necessary for
the proper administration of the service, and for the expansion
of the system to meet the requirements of the new settlements.
It was impossible for Stayner to give personal attention to the
duty of supervising postmasters, or to inquiries into the merits
of the numerous applications from all parts of the country for
new post offices.</p>

<p>The necessity for assistance in this direction was impressed on
Stayner by a number of robberies which took place on the grand
route between Montreal and Toronto&mdash;episodes in post office
economy which he was helpless to investigate.</p>

<p>Two of these robberies have incidents connected with them,
which are deserving of mention. In February 1835, on a stormy
night, the mail bag dropped off the courier's sleigh somewhere in
the neighbourhood of Prescott, and it could not be found. As
the contents of the bag included banknotes to the value of from
£10,000 to £12,000, a reward of £200 was offered for the conviction
of the thief and the recovery of the money.</p>

<p>Within half an hour after the placard was on view in Prescott,
a man who heard it read, exclaimed excitedly: "I know all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
it, I have the bag at home." It turned out that this man had
found the bag, rifled it, and used part of the money, and, carried
away with the prospect of the large reward, had actually informed
on himself.</p>

<p>The other case is noteworthy on account of the energy displayed
by the loser of a valuable letter, in pursuing and securing
the conviction of the thief. The letter, which contained £200,
was posted in Toronto, and addressed to a gentleman living near
L'Original. As the department, owing to the lack of effective
aid, was limited in its efforts to advertising the loss in the newspapers
and by placards, the loser of the letter took the inquiries
into his own hands.</p>

<p>He spent nearly a year in his investigations, travelling up and
down the country between Montreal and Toronto, and in the state
of New York, covering a distance of upwards of two thousand
one hundred miles. It is satisfactory to be able to say that he
managed to locate and secure the arrest and conviction of the
thief. So well had he done his work, that the deputy postmaster
general adjudged him to be entitled to the £50 reward offered by
the department.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">The beginnings of the postal service in the Maritime provinces&mdash;Complaints
of newspaper publishers&mdash;Reception given to imperial act to remedy
colonial grievances.</p></div>


<p>Up to this point the narrative since the American Revolution
has been confined to Upper and Lower Canada. The Maritime
provinces have been mentioned only in so far as it was necessary
to describe the means by which the Canadas maintained communication
with Great Britain. It is now time to relate the
events connected with the beginnings of the inland posts in the
Maritime provinces.</p>

<p>The post office in Halifax was the first opened in the provinces
now of the dominion of Canada. It was established as part of
the general scheme for closer and more regular communications
between the colonies and the mother country which was set on
foot as a consequence of the general alarm which seized the British
colonies after the annihilation of Braddock's army by the French
and Indians at fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>With the placing of a direct line of packets on the route between
Falmouth and New York for the conveyance of mails and despatches
a post office was demanded at Halifax, in order that Nova Scotia
might participate with the other colonies in the benefits of the
new service. When in 1755 the post office was opened at Halifax,
the English settlements in the Maritime provinces were very
recent and very few. The city was founded but six years before,
for the purpose of providing a military and naval station; and
in the year following, the capital of the province was transferred
thither from Annapolis.</p>

<p>In 1751 the only other settlement attached to the British
interest at this time was commenced. A number of Germans,
attracted by the advertising of the British government, arrived
at Halifax. After a short stay most of them re-embarked, and
sailing along the southern shore reached Malagash harbour, where
they laid the foundation of the town of Lunenburg. The settlement
was augmented by further arrivals in the two following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
years, and in 1753 its population numbered slightly over 1600.
In 1755 the total population in the two settlements of Halifax
and Lunenburg was about 5000, and these comprehended all that
could be regarded as British subjects.</p>

<p>Few additions were made to the population within the next
few years, though the government made a strong effort to re-people
the districts from which the Acadians had just been expelled. The
only other new settlement founded in the Maritime provinces
until the French power in America was broken by the capture of
Louisburg and of Quebec, was at Windsor, where a group from
New England entered upon the lands from which their former
possessors had been removed.</p>

<p>With the passing of the danger of molestation by the French,
there was an active movement into the provinces for a few years.
The beginnings of settlements were laid all along the Annapolis
valley from Windsor to Annapolis; also at several points on the
south shore between Halifax and Liverpool, and at the western
extremity of the province in the present county of Yarmouth.
Little groups established themselves at Truro and Amherst, and
on the adjacent lands of New Brunswick, at Sackville and Hopewell.</p>

<p>On the St. John river, a trading village was laid out in 1762
at Portland, now part of the city of St. John; and in 1763 an
important agricultural community was formed farther up the
river, at Maugerville, a few miles below Fredericton. In 1767 a
census was taken of the province, and the total population was
found to be over 13,000. Of these 1200 were in the territory
afterwards forming part of the province of New Brunswick, and
there were 500 in Prince Edward Island. The remaining number
were in Nova Scotia proper. The first movement of immigration
had now spent itself, and it was not until after the revolting
colonies had gained their independence that any great accession
was made to the population.</p>

<p>The incoming of the Loyalists was an event of the first magnitude
for the Maritime provinces. During the years 1783 and
1784, the population increased to threefold what it was when the
migration from the revolted American colonies began. They took
up lands in all parts of the provinces. Eighteen hundred householders
made homes for themselves in and about Annapolis,
while Digby, which until that time was quite unsettled, leaped into
the position of a village with a population of 1300.</p>

<p>Nearly all the settlements formed at this period had within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
them the elements of permanence, and they became the foundations
of the towns, villages and farming communities which cover
the Maritime provinces. Until the arrival of the Loyalists, there
were practically no inhabitants east of Halifax and Colchester
counties. Pictou was not entirely unoccupied, as a small group
from Pennsylvania and Maryland had come into the district in
1765, who were joined by a few Highland Scotch families in 1773.
But the total number was insignificant, and the two counties to
the eastward, Antigonishe and Guysboro, were still practically in
a state of nature. They were settled later by Scotchmen who
came to Pictou and Prince Edward Island.</p>

<p>New Brunswick benefited to a relatively greater extent than
Nova Scotia by the Loyalist movement. At the close of the war,
the number of English colonists in this province did not exceed
2500. These were scattered in small groups on Passamaquoddy
bay, on the St. John river, and on the Chignecto bay and
Petitcodiac river at the eastern end of the province.</p>

<p>By 1787, when the Loyalists had settled themselves, there was
a continuous line of settlements along the bay of Fundy from the
United States boundary at the St. Croix river to St. John harbour,
and with longer intervals onward to the eastern limits of the
province. On the St. John river and tributaries over 9000
people were settled. The cities of St. John and Fredericton, and
the towns of St. Stephen and St. Andrews sprang into existence
during this period.</p>

<p>On the north and east coasts of New Brunswick permanent
settlement had begun, the people being mostly Acadians. There
were small Scotch fishing settlements on the Miramichi and the
Restigouche rivers.</p>

<p>Communication among these settlements was carried on mostly
by water. Fishing vessels ran constantly between Halifax and
the harbours and coves on the seaboard. The settlements on the
bay of Fundy and the St. John river were brought into connection
with Halifax by way of Windsor, which lies near the mouth of the
Avon, one of the tributaries of the bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>Between Windsor and Halifax a road had been built by the
Acadians shortly after Halifax was founded, to enable them to
carry their cattle and produce to the new and promising market.
The inland settlements along the Annapolis valley had the advantage
of an ancient road, made by the Acadians running from
Pisiquid, as Windsor was first called, to the Annapolis basin.</p>

<p>The Loyalists and disbanded soldiers settled in the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
found themselves not ill-supplied with facilities for communicating
with one another, but the means of corresponding with the mother
country left much to be desired. On the establishment of the
packet service between Falmouth and New York in 1755, the
mails for Halifax brought out by the packets were sent from
New York to Boston, the postmaster of which town was instructed
to send them to Halifax by the first suitable war or merchant
vessel that offered.</p>

<p>Until the war broke out, there were numerous opportunities
for sending the mails to Halifax. The trade returns for 1759
show that during six months of that year one hundred and forty-eight
vessels entered Halifax harbour, much the greater proportion
of which were from New York or Boston. But with the outbreak
of the war, communication with the revolted colonies was carried
on at great risks, and the naval and military authorities at Halifax
made bitter complaint of the delays to their correspondence with
the home government.</p>

<p>With the restoration of peace, an immediate demand was made
for a direct packet line to Halifax, and there seemed every likelihood
at the time that the line would be established. Lord North
wrote to the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia in August 1783<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
that Halifax would doubtless increase in importance in becoming
the rendezvous of the fleet, and that he was asking the postmaster
general to put on a monthly packet to Halifax.</p>

<p>But other views prevailed. In November, the postmaster
general re-established the packet service to New York, and as
there were not sufficient vessels available for a separate line to
Halifax, the settlements in the Maritime provinces had to depend
on the New York service for their correspondence with the mother
country. The British post office maintained a packet agent at
New York, whose duty it was to take over the despatches and
mails brought by the packets for the British colonies, and send
them forward by the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The difficulties Finlay found in maintaining correspondence
between Canada and Great Britain by way of the New York
packets have been related. The Nova Scotia post office had no
less difficulty. There were few British vessels running between
Halifax and the ports of the United States, and consequently the
delays to the correspondence were often intolerable. The complaints
of the officials and of the merchants in Halifax were
incessant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>A memorial was presented to the government in 1785 by the
merchants of Halifax, pointing out the great injury to their trade
from the faulty arrangements. Lieutenant governor Parr, in
forwarding the memorial, expressed his entire concurrence in its
terms, and added that the mails which left England by the November
packet did not reach Halifax until the 11th of April following.</p>

<p>But fortunately Canada was now adding an insistent voice in
support of the demand of the Maritime provinces. Before peace
was declared, the governors of Canada and Nova Scotia were
canvassing the possibilities of facilitating communication between
their provinces. Despatch couriers passed between Quebec,
fort Howe and Halifax, and efforts were made to overcome the
obstacles to travel, particularly on the portage between the St.
Lawrence and lake Temiscouata.</p>

<p>The results had not been specially encouraging, but the determination
of the Americans to exact the last farthing that could
be got out of the exchanges between Canada and Great Britain,
which passed over their territory, and their unwillingness to assist
in expediting the exchanges in any way, compelled the Canadian
government to keep before it the question of the connections by
way of Halifax.</p>

<p>In 1785 the legislative council of Quebec discussed the question.
Finlay, who besides being deputy postmaster general, was a
member of the legislative council, impressed on his colleagues
the necessity of liberating Canada from its dependence on the
United States in its correspondence with the mother country.
The refusal of the postmaster general of the United States to
allow Canadian couriers to travel to New York, although there
was no regular exchange between New York and any United
States post office on the road to Canada, led to delays and exorbitant
charges, which were unendurable.</p>

<p>Finlay urged as a first step that Canada should make a passable
road as far as the New Brunswick border, believing that the home
government would see that the governments of New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia would provide the facilities for travel within
those provinces. Dorchester, the governor general, who had
taken much interest in the question, sent Finlay in 1787 to make
a survey of a route from Quebec to Halifax, and to arrange for
couriers to pass monthly between the two places. The British
government gave its approval to his efforts to establish a connection
between the British provinces, and on its part, arranged that,
commencing in March 1788, the packets which ran between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Falmouth and New York should call at Halifax during the eight
months from March to November of each year.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The call of the packets at Halifax, and the exchange of the
mails between Great Britain and Canada at that port marked
the commencement of the inland services in the Maritime provinces.
Post offices were opened at the important points on the route
between Halifax and Quebec.</p>

<p>The couriers passed through Fredericton and St. John in New
Brunswick, and Digby, Annapolis, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Horten'">Horton</ins> (now Wolfville) and
Windsor in Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> St. John post office was opened in
1784, the office of postmaster and king's printer being combined.
The courier between St. John and Fredericton travelled over his
route fortnightly, and a service of the same frequency was maintained
on the route in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>In order that the post office should have the advantage of
conveying the military despatches between the posts on the route,
the expresses which had been employed in this duty were suppressed,
much to the distaste of the military authorities, who
would henceforward have to pay the very high postal charges on
their letters.</p>

<p>These charges were prohibitive for all but very urgent letters.
A letter consisting of a single sheet cost twelve cents to carry it
from St. John to Fredericton if it weighed less than an ounce.
If it weighed over an ounce the charge was quadrupled. The
following are the rates charged by the postmaster at Halifax to
the several post offices in Nova Scotia: to Windsor fourpence;
to Horton sevenpence, and to Annapolis and Digby ninepence.</p>

<p>At the risk of repetition, the reader is reminded that these
charges are for letters consisting each of a single sheet, weighing
less than one ounce, and that in case the letters should weigh
above an ounce, the rates given were multiplied by four, as a
letter weighing over an ounce was regarded as equal to four letters.</p>

<p>The postage from Fredericton to London, England, was sixty-four
cents for a single letter. As one glances over the long newsy
letters in the published correspondence of the time, he is persuaded
that those letters did not pass through the post office. The lately
published Winslow correspondence<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> is full of such letters, but
they let us into the secret of how they came to be sent.</p>

<p>Leading Loyalists, men who had given up their comforts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
taken on themselves the severest hardships for the sake of the
old connections, thought no more than the merest rebels of evading
the postal laws, and sending their letters by any convenient means
that presented themselves. Ward Chipman, the solicitor general
of New Brunswick, in writing to Edward Winslow in London,
tells him that he would write more freely if it were not for the
enormous expense, but he would tax the good will of every person
he could hear of, who was going to England. No person was
allowed to go on a journey, long or short, without a pocketful
of letters entrusted to him by his friends, unless he were unusually
disobliging. When he reached his destination, he either delivered
the letters in person, or posted them in the local post office, whence
they were delivered at a penny apiece.</p>

<p>The service as established in 1788 was carried on unchanged
until the war of 1812 made certain alterations in the routes
necessary to secure the safe conveyance of the mails. The presence
of American privateers in the bay of Fundy rendered the passage
of the packets between St. John and Digby hazardous. The
course down the St. John river and across the bay to Digby was,
therefore, temporarily abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The courier with the mails from Quebec did not continue the
river route farther south than Fredericton. At that point he
turned inland, taking a road which led to the juncture with the
old Westmoreland road which ran from St. John to fort Cumberland,
on the eastern boundary of New Brunswick. The road from
fort Cumberland was continued on through Truro to Halifax.</p>

<p>For a short period before the war and during its course, the
deputy postmaster general was under steady pressure on the
part of the provincial governors to extend the means of communication
throughout the province of Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Population
was increasing rapidly&mdash;the census of 1817 gave it as 82,373&mdash;and
settlement was well distributed over all parts of the province.</p>

<p>The governors for their part were anxious to have the means
of corresponding easily with the militia, who were organized in
every county. The deputy postmaster general was in a position
of considerable embarrassment. His orders from the home office
as respects the expenditure of the postal revenue were as explicit
as those under which Heriot was struggling in Canada. He won
through his difficulties, however, with more success than attended
Heriot's efforts, although he did nothing that Heriot did not do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to meet the two incompatible demands of the post office, on the
one side, that he should establish no routes which did not pay
expenses, and of the local administration on the other, that he
should extend the service wherever it seemed desirable to the
governor.</p>

<p>Howe brought a little more tact than Heriot seemed capable
of, in dealing with the provincial authorities. He laid the commands
which had been impressed on him by the secretary of the
general post office before the legislature, and obtained the assistance
of that body in maintaining routes, which did not provide
sufficient postage to cover their expenses. On his part he engaged,
in disregard of the injunctions of the secretary, to allow all the
sums which were collected on a route to be applied to paying the
postmasters and mail couriers as far as these sums would go,
the legislature undertaking to make up the deficiencies.</p>

<p>In April 1817,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Howe made a comprehensive report of the mail
services in operation at that date, together with the arrangements
for their maintenance.</p>

<p>There were two principal routes in the province. The first
in local importance was that through the western counties from
Halifax to Digby and thence by packet to St. John. The section
between Halifax and Digby cost £348 a year, of which the legislature
paid £200. The packet service across the bay was maintained
by the legislatures of the two provinces. The settlements
beyond Digby as far as Yarmouth and on to Shelburne, were
served by a courier who received £130 from the legislature, and
all the postage on letters going to the settlements, which amounted
to £65 a year.</p>

<p>The second leading route was that between Halifax and
Fredericton by way of Truro. This route, which was begun in
1812, was discontinued at the close of the war. It had been found
so advantageous, however, that it was re-established in the beginning
of 1817, as the permanent route between Quebec and Halifax.</p>

<p>From Truro, a courier travelled through the eastern counties
to Pictou and Antigonishe. This was a district which Howe
regarded with much satisfaction. He wrote that the large immigration
from Scotland and other parts of Great Britain had increased
the number of settlements and thrown open the resources of this
part of the province to that extent, that the revenue of the eastern
districts would soon surpass that from those in the west.</p>

<p>Antigonishe collected the letters from all the eastern harbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and settlements, and although the post office had been open for
only about nine months, the results, as Howe conceived them,
were very encouraging. The expenses of the courier at this
period far outran the revenues, and accordingly the legislature
made a contribution of £130. The remainder of the shortage was
made up partly by postages and partly by private subscriptions.</p>

<p>Howe, the deputy postmaster general, set forth the favourable
aspects of the service with an eagerness that betokened nervousness,
and indeed there was some reason for this feeling. When
his statement reached England, the secretary at once drew the
attention of the postmaster general to the fact that, while Howe
had done extremely well, his actions in appropriating the revenue
to any specific object and in establishing new routes and making
new contracts without first receiving departmental sanction were
inconsistent with the principles which governed the post office.</p>

<p>But it was something that, while Heriot's official zeal was
embroiling him with the governor general of Canada, Howe was
managing to secure the good will of the lieutenant governor of his
province, and his compromises with post office principles were
passed over with a slight warning. Howe retired in 1818 on account
of old age, and was succeeded by his son, John Howe, junior.</p>

<p>The postal service of New Brunswick did not advance with
equal step with that of Nova Scotia. Until 1820 there was no
progress made in improving the system, except that the conveyance
between St. John and Fredericton had been increased from
fortnightly to weekly.</p>

<p>The first district off the established lines to manifest a desire
for postal accommodation was that on the Miramichi river.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
There were two flourishing settlements on the river&mdash;Chatham and
Newcastle&mdash;largely engaged in lumbering and fishing, and some
means for the exchange of letters was a necessity.</p>

<p>For some years before 1820 a courier travelled between these
settlements and Fredericton along the course of the Nashwaak
river. He was paid partly by a subsidy from the legislature of
New Brunswick, and partly by private subscription. Those who
did not subscribe to the courier, might or might not receive their
letters. It depended on the caprice of the courier. If he chose
to deliver them, he exacted a payment of eleven or twelve pence
for each letter. This arrangement was far from satisfactory, as
the following illustration will show.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>In February 1824, a brig from Aberdeen reached Halifax,
bringing a mail, which contained sixty letters for the Miramichi
settlements. These letters were forwarded to Fredericton by the
first courier. It happened that among the persons to whom the
letters were addressed were a number who were not subscribers, and
the courier refused to take the letters for these persons with him.</p>

<p>The consequence was that the letters had to be returned to
Halifax, to take the chance of the first vessel that might happen
to be sailing in that direction. To guard against any similar
mishap in future, Howe left the letters for the Miramichi districts
with the captains who had brought them over, and allowed them
to arrange for their onward transmission.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor of New Brunswick urged the establishment
of a regular post office on the Miramichi. The trade of
the district was of considerable proportions. In 1823, four hundred
and eight square-rigged vessels from the United Kingdom loaded
on the Miramichi. There was some bargaining between the
deputy postmaster general and the lieutenant governor. The
expense of the courier would be heavy, and the revenue from it
would not be large.</p>

<p>Howe proposed that the postages from the route be devoted
to its maintenance, and the balance be made up by the legislature.
Howe does not seem to have had his usual success in these negotiations,
for the governor declined to deal with him, insisting on
corresponding directly with the postmaster general in England.
This caused some delay, and it was not until 1825 that the post
office was sanctioned.</p>

<p>The year 1825 was a notable one in the history of the New Brunswick
post office. In that year several important offices were
opened. Howe, in his report to the postmaster general, gives an
interesting account of his trip in establishing these offices.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He
took a vessel from St. John to Dorchester, where he opened an
office; thence to Baie Verte, from which point he sailed to Miramichi
and to Richibucto. Returning to Dorchester he travelled to
Sussexvale.</p>

<p>Howe appointed postmasters at all these places. On arriving
at St. John, he was met by the request of the lieutenant governor
to open an office at St. Stephen. He finished up his tour by
visiting Gagetown and Kingston where offices were opened.</p>

<p>The very considerable enlargement of the system in New
Brunswick gave much satisfaction to the lieutenant governor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
But as usual the deputy postmaster general received a douche of
criticism from the secretary of the post office, who could not bear
to sanction an extension of the service which did not turn in
something to the treasury. Howe had, indeed, been careful that
the post office should not be even a temporary loser by his arrangements.
He had gone no further than to apply the postages
collected at the new offices to pay the postmasters and couriers,
as far as these sums would go. The postmaster general took a
larger view of Howe's activities, and expressed his gratification
at what had been accomplished.</p>

<p>It was during this period that Cape Breton was brought within
the postal system of the Maritime provinces. This island, which
had been the scene of great exploits during the French and English
wars, had not begun to come under permanent settlement until
after the close of the American revolution. After the fall of
Louisburg, in 1758, the island was attached to Nova Scotia, and
remained a part of that province until 1784, when it was erected
into a separate government.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant governor of Cape Breton, Major Desbarres,
in casting about for a suitable site for his capital, had the advantage
of an intimate knowledge of the coast line of the island, acquired
during a series of surveys of the coasts and harbours of the Maritime
provinces. Contrary to what might have been expected, he turned
away from Louisburg, and placed his capital in a town which he
established at the head of the southern arm of Spanish river.
Desbarres called the town Sydney, in honour of Lord Sydney,
the secretary of state for the colonies.</p>

<p>After an inglorious career of thirty-six years, notable only for
the perpetual strife which reigned among the administrative
officials, during which the domestic affairs of the colony were
almost entirely neglected, the colony of Cape Breton was re-annexed
to Nova Scotia in 1820.</p>

<p>The growth of population during this period was slow. In
1774 there were 1241 people on the island, including some roving
bands of Indians. On the west coast, about Arichat and Petit
de Grat, there were 405 persons, all French. About St. Peters
there was a mixed English and French population numbering
186; and on the east coast in a line running north and south of
Louisburg there were tiny settlements containing in all 420
persons, nearly all English.</p>

<p>So little progress had been made during the last quarter of the
eighteenth century, that at the end of 1801 the population was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
only 2531, of whom 801 were in the Sydney district, and 192
in and about Louisburg. The remainder were strung along the
west coast from Arichat to Margaree harbour.</p>

<p>The increase on the west coast was due to a number of Highland
Scotch immigrants, who reached Cape Breton by way of Pictou,
and took up land between the Gut of Canso and Margaree harbour.
In 1802, the Scotch movement into Cape Breton began to
assume considerable proportions. A ship bringing 300 settlers
into Sydney, was followed by others year after year, until, at the
date when Cape Breton again became part of Nova Scotia, the
population had reached between eight and nine thousand, most
of whom were Highland Scotch. The district about Arichat
remained French.</p>

<p>There was a post office in Cape Breton as early as 1801. It
was at Sydney, with A. C. Dodd as postmaster.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Dodd was a man
of prominence on the island, being a member of the legislative
council and afterwards chief justice. He held the postmastership
until 1812, when he was succeeded by Philip Eley, who was in
office in 1817, when the lieutenant governor, General Ainslie, pointed
out to the home government the necessity of improving the
communications between the island and Great Britain.</p>

<p>The exchange of correspondence was slow and uncertain. The
Cape Breton mails were exchanged by the Halifax packet, but it
was usual for two months to elapse between the arrival of the
letters from England and the first opportunity of replying to
them. Half the delay, Ainslie thought, might be avoided, if the
packets on their homeward voyages would lie off the harbour of
Louisburg for an hour or two to enable a small boat to reach the
packet.</p>

<p>The commanders in port at Falmouth were consulted, and gave
it as their opinion that the fogs and currents, which prevailed about
Louisburg would make it inadvisable to attempt to land the mails
there, and the proposition was rejected. In the winter of 1817,
an overland communication was opened between Sydney and
Halifax, an Indian carrying the mails between the two places
once a month during the winter.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> When the annexation of Cape
Breton to Nova Scotia took place in 1820, the lieutenant governor
of Nova Scotia, Sir James Kempt, managed to obtain a weekly
mail between Sydney and Halifax.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest period in which we find a postal service in operation
in Prince Edward Island is 1801.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> John Ross is mentioned as
postmaster of the island in that year. He was succeeded by
Benjamin Chappell, in whose hands and in those of his family,
the postmastership remained for over forty years.</p>

<p>The connections with the mainland and the mother country
were maintained for some years by such vessels as happened to
visit the island. The postal service of the island was within the
jurisdiction of Nova Scotia. It was not, however, until 1816, that
the deputy postmaster general made any mention of the island
service in his reports to the general post office in London.</p>

<p>Howe then informed the postmaster general<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> that when Lord
Selkirk was in Nova Scotia some years before, that nobleman
urged upon him the necessity of a courier service to Pictou, and
thence to Prince Edward Island by packet. This service was
established in 1816, and an arrangement was made with the island
government, by which the postage was to be applied as far as it
would go to maintain the packet and pay the postmaster's salary,
and the government would make up the balance.</p>

<p>There were no accounts between the island post office and the
general post office. The postmaster simply presented to the deputy
postmaster general periodical statements of the postages collected,
and his expenses, together with a receipt for the deficiency which
was paid by the government. This arrangement had the immense
advantage that from the very first the island service was in the
hands of the local government, which carried on the post office
with no more than a formal reference to the general post office.
The postage on a single letter from Charlottetown to Halifax was
eightpence.</p>

<p>The communication between the Maritime provinces and the
mother country was the subject of some discussion. Halifax was
determined to retain, and extend the utility of the packet service
at all costs. Owing to the greatness of the charges, and the long
delays, the Canadian merchants made but little use of the Halifax
packets, but had their letters sent by way of New York.</p>

<p>The merchants of New Brunswick insisted on the same privilege.
The provincial government established two courier services between
St. John and Fredericton, and St. Andrews on the United States
boundary, and the United States post office arranged to have the
British mails for New Brunswick conveyed by its couriers to
Robbinstown, a point in Maine a short distance from St. Andrews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Against this Nova Scotia protested. John Howe, the elder,
came out of his retirement in 1820, and made a strong plea for an
exclusive packet service between England and Halifax, the vessel
to remain at Halifax for one week before returning. He would
have the public despatches for New York and Bermuda brought to
Halifax, and from that place forwarded to their destination by one
of the war vessels in the harbour or by a packet kept for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Buchanan, the British consul at New York, urged the opposite
view, that all the British mails for the colonies should be sent
by way of New York. Dalhousie, who was lieutenant governor
in Nova Scotia, at the time supported Howe's view, and matters
remained as they were.</p>

<p>The question of newspaper postage was agitated in the Maritime
provinces, as well as in the provinces of Canada. Indeed it would
be inconceivable that publishers anywhere could be satisfied
with the arrangements then in operation. But, most curiously,
when the question came before the house of assembly in Nova
Scotia, the sympathies of that body ran, not with the publishers,
but with the deputy postmaster general.</p>

<p>In 1830, Edmund Ward, a printer, who published a newspaper
in Fredericton, petitioned the legislature to be relieved of the
charges for the conveyance of his paper. The post office committee
of the house of assembly in Nova Scotia took the application into
their consideration.</p>

<p>The committee reported<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> to the house that, having examined
the imperial acts, they were of opinion that it was no part of the
duty of the deputy postmaster general to receive, or transmit by
post, newspapers printed in the colonies, or coming from abroad
except from Great Britain. They found, moreover, that the
secretary of the general post office in London, under this view of
the case, had for a long time made a charge for each paper sent
to the colonies by packet, the proceeds from which he retained
to his own use.</p>

<p>It also appeared that about sixty years before that date (that
is about 1770), the deputy postmaster general made a charge of
two shillings and sixpence per annum on each newspaper forwarded
to country subscribers by post, which was acquiesced in by all
the publishers at that time.</p>

<p>The committee believed, therefore, that the deputy postmaster
general was fully justified in the charges he made, but they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
much in favour of having newspapers transmitted free. In
accordance with this idea, the committee suggested that the
assembly should take on itself the charges due for the conveyance
of newspapers. They found that there were seventeen hundred
newspapers of local origin distributed by post each week, and three
hundred British or foreign newspapers. The assembly did not
act on this suggestion.</p>

<p>Though the deputy postmaster general was fortunate enough
to have the support of the legislature in his contention with the
publishers, his position was by no means free from criticism.
Indeed, there were certain features in his case, which were peculiarly
exasperating to the publishers.</p>

<p>Howe was not only deputy postmaster general, but was king's
printer, and had in his hands the whole of the provincial printing.
He was also interested either directly or through his family in
most of the newspapers published in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p><i>The Nova Scotian</i>, <i>The Journal</i>, <i>The Acadian</i> and <i>The Royal
Gazette</i>, were all controlled by the Howe family, and it appeared
in the examination that all these newspapers were distributed by
the post office free of postage. There were two other newspapers
published in Halifax&mdash;<i>The Acadian Recorder</i> and <i>The Free Press</i>&mdash;and
the publishers felt, not unnaturally, that in being compelled
to pay two shillings and sixpence for each copy transmitted by post,
while their rivals had the benefit of distribution by the post office
free of charge, they were being subjected to an unjust and injurious
discrimination.</p>

<p>The publishers of <i>The Recorder</i> and of <i>The Free Press</i> presented
a petition to the king, asking that they, also, might be relieved
from the burden of paying postage on their newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Just
as their claim appeared to be, it had no support from the authorities
in the colony. The lieutenant governor in sending the petition
to the colonial office, took occasion to speak of the high character
of Howe and of his father, the preceding deputy postmaster general,
and to express his opinion that the small fee collected on newspapers
could not be regarded as an extravagant compensation
for the trouble the deputy postmaster general had in the matter.</p>

<p>The case of the publishers came before the postmaster general
in 1834. Freeling, the secretary, then reminded him that there
was no urgency in the matter, as they were engaged at the time
in adjusting the relations between the colonial governments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the post office, and if the provincial legislatures accepted the
settlement proposed by the home government, the question of
newspaper postage would be satisfactorily disposed of.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the petition was easily answered. The
practice, argued the secretary, was not illegal as it was founded
on an act of parliament empowering the postmaster general to
give to certain of his officers the right to distribute newspapers
by post. This right had been in existence since the first establishment
of a post office and of a newspaper in the colony. Consequently
the petitioners, in entering upon the business of publishing
a newspaper, must have been aware of the charges to which
the publishers would be liable.</p>

<p>The imperial bill of 1834, together with the draft bill prepared
by the post office for the acceptance of the provinces reached the
lieutenant governors of the provinces in January 1835. The object
of the plans, it will be remembered, was in effect to have the stamp
of legality placed on the existing arrangements, by obtaining for
them the sanction of the several provincial legislatures.</p>

<p>On the adoption by the legislatures of the several bills, which
were identical in form, the postmaster general would relinquish
the powers he had until that time exercised over the revenues of
the provincial system, and allow the surplus, if any should arise,
to be distributed among the provinces, leaving it also with them
to make up the deficit in case the expenditure exceeded the revenue.</p>

<p>The proposals of the postmaster general were received characteristically
by the different provinces. Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick had no fault to find with the existing arrangements.
So far from objecting to the irregular emoluments of the deputy
postmaster general for the Maritime provinces, they recommended,
when the question arose, that his emoluments be increased. Whenever
the lieutenant governor or the legislature of either of the
provinces desired the extension of the postal system into sparsely
settled and unremunerative districts, the local governments without
demur took the deficiencies on themselves, and did not ask
why the profits from the more populous districts were not devoted
to meeting these shortages.</p>

<p>When the imperial scheme for settling the difficulties of the
colonial postal system was laid before the legislatures of the Maritime
provinces, it found them quite unprepared to discuss it.
Until then, they had apparently not realized that any such difficulties
existed. The thirteen years controversy between the British
post office and the assemblies in Upper and Lower Canada appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to have excited no attention in the lower provinces. When the
proposition from the British post office was submitted to the
assembly in New Brunswick, it was put aside until the following
session, and then, as it appeared not to suit the views of the
assembly, it was dropped.</p>

<p>In Nova Scotia, the subject received more consideration. The
draft bill was referred to a committee of the legislature, which
went thoroughly into its merits. The committee were of opinion<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
that, if modified in certain respects, the bill would be well adapted
to accomplish the object in view. In their view the bill should
not be a permanent one, but should be renewable every three years,
in order that any defects, which experience might disclose, could
be remedied.</p>

<p>It also seemed advisable to the committee that the chief
administrative officer in the province should be selected, not by
the postmaster general, but by the governor of the province, who
would be more conversant with the character and abilities of
persons qualified to discharge the duties of the office.</p>

<p>As the legislatures of Canada and New Brunswick had declined
to adopt the bill, the committee would not recommend that any
bill should be adopted that session. The only point to which they
invited the attention of His Majesty's government was the salary
of the deputy postmaster general, which was not only inadequate,
but would not bear comparison with the emoluments of the deputy
in the other provinces.</p>

<p>The Nova Scotian assembly did not, however, rest at this
point. Though they had acquiesced quite contentedly in the
arrangements made by Howe, the deputy postmaster general,
and had shown no disposition to join the Canadas in their agitation,
the implied admission of the home government that the surplus
post office revenues belonged of right to the colonies, put a different
face on the subject.</p>

<p>The post office committee called the deputy postmaster general
before them, and on going over the accounts with his assistance,
they discovered that there was a considerable amount remitted
annually to England, as profit from their inland posts, and satisfied
themselves that if this amount were retained by the deputy postmaster
general, and devoted to paying for the unremunerative
services, the sum contributed by the province for the maintenance
of these services would be much reduced, if not wiped out
altogether.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>The legislature, thereupon, with a boldness which seemed to
betoken ignorance of the course of events in Canada, resolved to
take over the control of the provincial post office. A bill for that
purpose was adopted in 1838,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and received the assent of the
lieutenant governor. By it, the deputy postmaster general was
directed to pay into the provincial treasury any surplus revenue,
and the legislature on its part undertook to make good any deficiency,
if such should arise.</p>

<p>The position of matters as regards the inland service of Nova
Scotia was complicated by the geographical situation of the
province with reference to the other provinces. The British
packets, by which mails were exchanged between Great Britain
and the North American colonies, landed at Halifax, and it was
essential that the conveyance of the mails across Nova Scotia
between Halifax and the inland provinces should be maintained
unimpeded.</p>

<p>The legislature recognized this fact, and agreed to provide for
this through service at its own cost, on condition that the British
post office should pay the salaries of the deputy postmaster general
and his staff at Halifax, from the revenues of the packet service.</p>

<p>The home government disallowed the Nova Scotia bill as being
inconsistent with the objects sought to be accomplished by the
imperial act of 1834. The aim of that act was to secure a uniform
code of laws for the regulation of the posts in British North America.
Any partial legislation would be unacceptable, and this was
particularly the case with legislation on the part of Nova Scotia,
the key to British North America. By obtaining control over
the expenditure for the mail service through the province, the
legislature of Nova Scotia would have the entire power over the
postal communications with the interior, and they might not only
object to defray the expense of particular services, but might
interdict them altogether, as, in their opinion, unnecessary.</p>

<p>The colonial secretary added another consideration to this
argument of the postmaster general. One of the chief advantages
which the government hoped to derive from the mission of Lord
Durham, who was then in Canada, was that of devising some plan
for the regulation of questions, which, like that of post office
communications, was the subject of common interest to the
colonies collectively.</p>

<p>The assembly showed some resentment at the rejection of their
bill. The despatch informing the governor that the measure had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
been disallowed, also contained notice of the refusal of the home
government to sanction several other acts adopted by the Nova
Scotia legislature. In the resolution expressing regret that the
measures in question had not been allowed to go into operation,
the assembly were careful to intimate their confidence in the
disposition of Her Majesty to meet the reasonable expectations
of the assembly, and attributed the several disallowances to a want
of correct information on the part of the home government due
to its not going to the proper sources therefor.</p>

<p>In order to remove the misunderstanding which the assembly
conceived to exist between themselves and the home government,
William Young and Herbert Huntingdon were sent as delegates
to confer with the colonial secretary on this and other subjects
lying open. In London the delegates were brought into communication
with the treasury.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>As the chief objection to the Nova Scotia bill for the regulation
of the post office was that it would give the government of that
province control over the posts to the provinces in the interior,
the delegates lost no time in disclaiming any desire to exercise
control over any but their own inland service. They were willing
that the great through lines should remain within the jurisdiction
of the postmaster general of Great Britain, and that the provincial
authority should be confined to the management of the side or
cross posts. This proposed dual control was, of course, obviously
impracticable, as the whole provincial service, with its main lines
and cross lines, was so blended together, that any attempt to treat
them as under two different administrations could not fail to lead
to unfortunate results.</p>

<p>The mission of the delegates was, however, far from fruitless.
The fact that the legislature had without complaint paid out
considerable sums each year for the maintenance of the service,
appeared to the British government to entitle Nova Scotia to
liberal treatment, as these payments would not have been
demanded if the post office had understood the matter.</p>

<p>The treasury, therefore, decided that so long as the revenue from
the inland post office was sufficient to meet the expenditure for the
inland communications, no demand for that purpose should be
made upon the provincial funds. Should, however, the legislature
deem it advisable to add to the lines of communication, the treasury
would rely upon the legislature to defray the expenses of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
additional communications, so far as these were not covered by
the augmented postage receipts.</p>

<p>There was no more than justice in this decision, but the concessions
of the treasury did not stop at this point. It also intimated
its willingness to allow all the packet or ocean postage collected
in the colonies to remain at the disposal of the local government,
whenever the imperial act of 1834 should come into operation.</p>

<p>The British government did not desire to force the imperial
act upon the colonies, if, as appeared to be the case, there were
valid objections to it. It was prepared to consider any amendments
which might be proposed to meet those objections. The
packet postage, it should be explained, belonged entirely to the
British government which provided and paid all the expenses of
the packet service, so that the offer to allow the local governments
to retain for their own use the packet postage they collected, was
a real concession.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Continuance of agitation in the Canadas for control of the post office&mdash;Much
information obtained by committees of legislatures&mdash;Difficulty in giving
effect to reforms.</p></div>


<p>The proposals of the British post office for removing the objections
to the existing arrangements without endangering the efficiency
of the colonial postal system had a very different reception in the
assemblies of Upper and Lower Canada from that which they met
with in the Maritime provinces.</p>

<p>Owing to a general indisposition on the part of the legislatures
of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to push their contentions to
extremes, and doubtless also, to the fortunate relationship between
the deputy postmaster general of the Maritime provinces and
Joseph Howe, the leader of the reform party in Nova Scotia, the
post office had been subject to no authoritative criticism in those
provinces up to the time when the plans of the British post office
were laid before the legislatures.</p>

<p>In the Canadas the situation was exactly the reverse, as regards
both the state of public feeling and the claims of the deputy
postmaster general upon the forbearance of the assemblies.</p>

<p>The discussion of political grievances was arousing in the
popular party a bitterness which was fast carrying the agitation
for remedies beyond constitutional bounds; and as for Stayner,
he had quite alienated from himself the good will of the assemblies
in Upper and Lower Canada, by his open identification of himself
with the government party. When, therefore, the British proposals
were laid before the assembly of Upper Canada by the lieutenant
governor in 1835, they were rejected with the contemptuous
observation that the provisions of the proposed bill were so absurd
and inapplicable that no benefit could be expected from any
attempt to amend them.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The legislatures were not aware of the circumstances which
had led to the British proposals. The fact that the views for
which they had contended had been upheld by authorities so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
eminent as the law officers of the crown was withheld from them.
The changed attitude of the postmaster general was therefore
regarded by the assemblies as a proof of the success of their agitation,
and they girded themselves up for renewed efforts.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to fresh attacks the assemblies in both
provinces demanded from Stayner a mass of information, the extent
of which filled him with dismay. But no further refusals on his
part were possible. The colonial office was scarcely more pleased
with Stayner and his methods than the provincial assemblies were,
and the postmaster general was requested to see there were no
more concealments.</p>

<p>The work which fell upon Stayner in the preparation of the
returns called for was enormous. As printed by the legislature
of Lower Canada, the documents produced filled two hundred and
sixty-eight quarto pages. Stayner appears to have withheld
nothing. He became as effusive as he had formerly been reticent.
He published letters written by himself to his official superiors,
which must have proved embarrassing to them.</p>

<p>In the correspondence Stayner disclosed was a letter from the
postmaster of Montreal, pleading for a more suitable room for
his post office.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> From this letter it appears that in 1835, the post
office in Montreal was in the upper storey of a building standing
between the <i>Gazette</i> printing establishment and a boarding house,
and underneath it was a tailoring and dry goods shop. To get
to the post office the public had to grope up an unlighted flight of
stairs at the risk of their limbs, and when they reached the top
they had to make their way across a small lobby half-filled with
firewood.</p>

<p>As an inducement to the department to provide more suitable
quarters, the postmaster stated that the merchants were so
sensible of the inconvenience and danger from fire, that the postmaster
thought they would help with the erection of a proper
building, if applied to.</p>

<p>Stayner also produced the copy of a letter he had written a
short time before, to the secretary of the general post office protesting
his inability to meet the wants of the provinces with the
means which the postmaster general had placed at his disposal.
The letter deals chiefly with the conditions in Upper Canada, and
as a description of the situation in that province it could not be
bettered. The occasion of the letter was a complaint made by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
gentleman in England that it had taken from the 12th of June until
the 12th of October for a letter, addressed by him to his son in Barrie,
to reach its destination.</p>

<p>Stayner in reporting on the subject, admitted that this was
quite likely the case, but insisted that no blame was imputable
to him. The nearest post office to Barrie was from thirty to forty
miles distant, and it was probable that the letter had lain a couple
of months at that office before being called for.</p>

<p>The case of the Barrie settlers was typical of that of thousands
of well-educated people inhabiting the back parts of Upper Canada,
where they had formed thriving towns and villages from twenty
to fifty miles from the existing posts. These people with whom
postal accommodation was almost a necessity of life were entirely
without the means of corresponding with their distant friends,
unless they sent and received their letters by private agency.</p>

<p>Stayner declared that he was well within bounds in saying that
at that moment there were between two hundred and three hundred
distinct societies of people spread over the country in Upper Canada
alone, who, like the settlers in Barrie, were suffering from want of
that accommodation which he would fain give them, if he had the
power to do it. The case was to be the more lamented from the
fact that the reasonable wants of these people could be supplied
without burdening the post office revenue.</p>

<p>So active was the spirit of enterprise amongst the class of
persons crowding into the new settlements throughout the whole
extent of Upper Canada, as well as in many parts of the lower
province, and so great was their disposition for letter writing, that
Stayner was sure in a short time the increased revenue would amply
repay the outlay required. But with the assistance allowed him,
it was impossible to meet those demands.</p>

<p>It was indispensable that he should have at least two travelling
officers, whose duty it should be to examine into the merits of
applications, to settle questions of site, and arrange for mail
carriers. As for mail carriers, Stayner believed that the surveyors
would save their salaries by that item alone, as in the absence of
officials who would make arrangements on the spot, the post office
was being constantly exposed to imposition by carriers, against
which it was impossible to provide.</p>

<p>During the first five years he had been in office, Stayner had
increased the number of offices under his control from ninety to
two hundred and seventy, but beyond that it was impossible for
him, with his present assistance, to go. The parts of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
where new offices were called for were so remote, and the means
of information so unsatisfactory that it would be improper for him
to open offices and make contracts for serving them, without the
advice of persons acting under his orders, upon whose judgment
he could rely.</p>

<p>At that moment, Stayner further told the committee, the
provinces of Upper and Lower Canada required not less than five
hundred offices, that is, practically double the number then in
operation, and in ten years, at least one thousand offices would be
necessary to provide the requisite accommodation. With proper
assistance he could establish and put into successful operation all
that were wanted at the rate of one hundred a year. Less than
that scale of advancement would fail to satisfy the public.</p>

<p>The complaints of the people had become so loud and threatening
that, unless they were speedily met, Stayner was apprehensive
they would be engrafted upon the catalogue of provincial grievances.
Before he left England, Stayner had the postmaster general's
promise that two surveyors would be at once appointed. He had
waited as long as he felt that he dared, but the situation had
become so alarming, that he had taken it upon himself to appoint
two surveyors who would act under his directions, until regular
appointments could be made.</p>

<p>After Stayner laid before the houses of assembly in the two
provinces the various returns they had called for, committees
were struck in each house to consider the information contained
in the statements. The committee in Lower Canada took the
evidence of Stayner and of William Lyon Mackenzie who happened
to be in Quebec at the time, conferring with the reform leaders
in Lower Canada.</p>

<p>Mackenzie's statement was a general arraignment of the administration
of the post office. He declared that, as then constituted,
the post office in the opinion of the assembly of Upper
Canada, was an illegal institution, monopolizing the conveyance
of epistolary correspondence which it taxes heavily, and appropriating
the proceeds in England, without the knowledge and
consent of the assembly.</p>

<p>It arbitrarily and often capriciously, the reformer from Upper
Canada complained, fixed the sites of post offices, and dismissed
and appointed the incumbents. It resolved that one section of
the country, though thickly settled, should have no post offices,
while another part which was almost destitute of inhabitants
had regular mails. Newspapers were taxed at such a rate as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
post office thought fit, and the proceeds were held by the deputy
postmaster general as his perquisite.</p>

<p>In short, Mackenzie was emphatic in his declaration that
the establishment was a poor substitute for a provincial post office,
which would be regulated by law, and its revenues disposed of by
the authority of the legislature. He gave some curious illustrations
of the inequalities which marked the operation of the newspaper
regulations.</p>

<p>While Mackenzie was in England, Joseph Hume secured the
production of a number of documents relating to the Canadian
post office, which the legislatures in Canada had tried in vain to
obtain from Stayner. Among these was a statement showing the
amount paid by the several newspaper publishers for the distribution
of their papers by the post office. On looking over the list
Mackenzie was surprised at the very moderate amounts paid by
publishers of some of the most widely-circulated papers. <i>The
Montreal Gazette</i>, for instance, distributed nearly two thousand
copies by post, but paid postage on only two hundred and fifty copies.</p>

<p>Mackenzie made some further inquiries, and found that all
sorts of irregularities prevailed, which Stayner in the weakness of
his position was fain to connive at. The publisher of one paper
in Kingston told Mackenzie that he entered seventy-five copies
as sent by post, while mailing four hundred copies; another
reported sixty copies and sent three hundred. A third publisher,
who objected to paying the usual charge of four shillings per copy
per annum, was let off with two shillings and sixpence per copy;
while a fourth publisher paid no postage at all for several years.</p>

<p>Until that time Mackenzie had been paying the regular charges
for all copies of his newspaper&mdash;<i>The Colonial Advocate</i>&mdash;which he
sent by mail. But he determined to be no longer the victim of
such barefaced discrimination, and he accordingly began to enter for
postage only a part of the total issue distributed through the mails.</p>

<p>In order that he might not be open to a charge of dishonesty,
and perhaps also to help in the exposure of a vicious system,
Mackenzie told the postmaster at Toronto what he was doing, and
at the same time published the facts in his newspaper. This, of
course, could not be tolerated by Stayner, and he demanded from
Mackenzie the full postage on all his papers sent through the mails.</p>

<p>Mackenzie refused to pay, but declared that if Stayner would
allow the case to go before a jury in Toronto, Stayner might employ
all the counsel in the colony to support his demand, and if the jury
could be persuaded to render a verdict against him, he pledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
himself to pay the demand and all expenses. The offer was, of
course, declined and the claim was dropped.</p>

<p>In the course of a long examination, Stayner was taken over
all the points in controversy between the postmaster general and
the Canadian provinces. Dr. O'Callaghan,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> who soon afterwards
acquired notoriety as a leader in the rebellion, was chairman of
the committee. He and his associates in the inquiry had sat on
several earlier committees and were well versed in the points at issue.</p>

<p>With the aid of the documents produced, the O'Callaghan
committee managed to elicit from Stayner a fairly complete statement
of the position of the post office in the Canadas in 1834-1835.
Asked as to his authority for appropriating to his own use the
proceeds of the newspaper postage, he was unable to point to it.
But he stated that he knew it had been repeatedly recognized by
the head of the department in London, and he had never considered
it incumbent upon him or even proper to inquire into the date or
form of the authority.</p>

<p>To a committee convinced that everything appertaining to the
post office bore the marks of illegality, this answer could not be
satisfactory. Stayner was consequently next asked whether he
considered that any usage, precedent or custom could give him a
right to tax any portion of His Majesty's subjects without the
express consent of parliament. To this he replied in the negative,
but added that he never doubted that the postmaster general, in
permitting his deputy in Canada to send newspapers through the
post for a compensation to himself, was borne out by law.</p>

<p>What the statute was which the postmaster general held to be
his authority, Stayner could not, with confidence, say. But it
occurred to him that it might be an act passed in 1763,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> which
confirmed certain officers attached to the principal secretaries of
state and to the postmaster general, in the privilege which they
long enjoyed of franking newspapers and other printed matter.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this was the statute cited by the postmaster
general when required to produce his authority for allowing Stayner
and other deputies to treat the proceeds from newspapers as their
perquisites, and as we consider this act, we may admire the
prudence with which Stayner declined an argument as to its
sufficiency as authority for the practice.</p>

<p>Stayner was on firmer ground when he pointed out that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
post office act had made no provision for the conveyance of newspapers,
and that, as things stood, the only alternatives before the
publishers were to pay the prohibitive letter rates on their newspapers,
or to come to terms with him, under the permission of the
postmaster general.</p>

<p>The committee were loath to leave this controversial advantage
with Stayner and asked him whether, since the newspapers were
carried in the mail bags, he paid from the newspaper postage any
part of the mail couriers' wages. He said he did not, and then
committed himself to the extraordinary proposition that it cost
nothing to carry newspapers because they were in the same bags
with the letters. The committee did not waste any time arguing
such a point as that, but called the contractor for the conveyance
of the mails between Montreal and Quebec, who testified that if
he were relieved of the newspapers, he could carry the mails on
horseback, at a saving of £200 a year.</p>

<p>The O'Callaghan committee in their report to the assembly&mdash;a
report which was made on the 8th of March, 1836, invited
attention in the first place to the large sums which were sent by
the deputy postmaster general to England from the revenues
of the Canadian post office. During the thirteen years ended in
1834, the large amount of £91,685 sterling had been remitted to
the British treasury on this account, and the remittances for the
last four years averaged annually £10,041 sterling.</p>

<p>These remittances, and the usage under which they were made,
the committee denounced as a violation of the fundamental rights
of the people of the colony, and as an instance of the disregard of
the declaratory act of 1778, which had cost Great Britain her
American colonies, "now the flourishing and happy United States
of America." Regarding the imperial act of 1834 as an admission
that the British government had acted illegally in appropriating
to its own use the surplus Canadian postal revenues, the committee
assumed that the deputy postmaster general would cease to make
remittances of Canadian revenues to England.</p>

<p>On discovering that this was not the case, the committee gave
Stayner notice that the assembly would probably hold him
personally responsible for any further remittances thus improperly
made. Stayner, however, paid no attention to this warning, as
he had but a short time before deposited $20,000 in the commissariat
office for transmission to London.</p>

<p>Stayner's course in treating the newspaper postage as his
perquisite came in for the strongest reprobation. The statutory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
authority which he ventured to put forward was easily shown
to be no authority at all, and the committee declared it to be a
monstrous absurdity that the head of the department should,
in defiance of all law, presume to fix the charges on newspapers,
and put the proceeds in his pocket.</p>

<p>From the statement furnished by Stayner, it appeared that no
less than £9550 currency had been appropriated by him from this
source during the six years he had held the office of deputy postmaster
general, and the committee suggested that, as he had no
shadow of right to any part of this large sum, legal proceedings
should be taken by the province to recover the amount from him.</p>

<p>The total income which Stayner acknowledged having received
was beyond belief. In each of the three years ending with and
including 1834, his emoluments amounted on the average to
£3185 currency. These emoluments were described graphically
by the committee as nearly equal to the salary of the governor
general, three times more than the salary of any of the puisne
judges in the province, almost equal to the whole amount paid
as compensation to the one hundred and thirty-seven postmasters
in Upper Canada, and one-third more than the total amount
received by the one hundred and seventeen postmasters in Lower
Canada.</p>

<p>The committee endeavoured to convict Stayner of having
misled the postmaster general as to the magnitude of his income.
They were unsuccessful in this attempt, as the postmaster general
was quite aware of the amount Stayner was receiving, and had
expressed no disapproval.</p>

<p>The committee as a conclusion to its report urged that the
provincial government should take over the control of the provincial
post office, and they submitted the draft of a bill which
they had prepared for the purpose of sanctioning the action recommended.
The house of assembly adopted the report of the committee,
and having passed the bill, sent it up to the legislative
council for approval.</p>

<p>In the legislative council the bill was rejected. The majority
of the council were Stayner's friends, and they saw that he had a
full chance to express his views before a committee appointed by
the council. He set the draft bill prepared by the postmaster
general beside the assembly bill, and effectively contrasted the
strong points of the former with the weakness of the latter.</p>

<p>The imperial bill, Stayner emphasised before the committee
of the council, dealt with British North America as one territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
as regards regulations and charges, and in his opinion, unless the
several provinces were to be so regarded, an efficient service among
the provinces themselves, and between the provinces and other
countries, would be impossible.</p>

<p>In order to encourage correspondence between the distant
parts of the colonies, the imperial bill fixed the comparatively low
rate of eighteen pence for all distances beyond five hundred miles.
Thus a letter could be sent from Amherstburg to Halifax or
Charlottetown for that sum. If each colony had its own separate
postal administration the charge on letters passing between those
places would, in the most favourable circumstances, cost two or
three times as much. Stayner was far from agreeing that, in all
its details, the imperial bill was perfect, but he was convinced that
the principle on which it was based was the only practicable one.</p>

<p>The great objection Stayner saw in the bill of the assembly
was that it was a local bill operative only within the province.
Intercourse between Lower Canada and the other provinces had
to be provided for, since where there are several states under one
supreme head, the free exchange of correspondence between them
is indispensable.</p>

<p>The British government, whose interests in the different provinces
required that communication between them and the mother
country should be uninterrupted, could never consent, Stayner
was sure, to any local arrangements by which those communications
might be jeopardized. The cost of communication between
province and province would be prohibitive, and the consequence
would be moral isolation. The separate states of the American
Union, jealous as they were of any impairment of their rights,
recognized the necessity of a common postal service.</p>

<p>Stayner dwelt convincingly on the technical difficulties of
accounting and distributing the charges on inter-provincial correspondence,
and on correspondence between Canada and Great
Britain. As it happened at the time, most of the letters sent
between Canada and England passed by way of the United States.
But that was a courtesy on the part of the United States government
which might be terminated at any time, and then the
Canadian provinces would be entirely dependent on the province
by the sea.</p>

<p>If each province charged its full local rates on correspondence
passing through it, and Stayner could see no reason why any of
the provinces should favour its neighbours at the expense of its
own people, the charge on a letter sent from Upper Canada to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
England would not be less than six or seven shillings, while under
the British draft bill, the charge would scarcely ever exceed two
shillings.</p>

<p>The legislative council adopted Stayner's reasoning entirely.
It admitted that if the post office were an institution of merely
local utility, there would be little to amend in the bill sent up
by the assembly. Since, however, there were several provinces
concerned, whose concurrent action was essential, the conflict of
interest which must inevitably arise would make the harmonious
working of the separate parts of the system difficult, if not
impossible.</p>

<p>As an instance of the difficulties springing out of the divergence
of interest among the provinces, the council recalled the
fact that it became necessary to invite the intervention of the
mother country to settle the apportionment of the customs revenues
between the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. The council
suggested to the governor general that if this line of reasoning
were found acceptable, a satisfactory settlement of the whole
question would be reached by requiring the deputy postmaster
general to furnish annually full information as to the conditions,
financial and other, of the post office.</p>

<p>The free transmission of the correspondence of members of the
legislature, the council urged, should be provided for. The deputy
postmaster general should be removable on the joint address of
the two houses of the legislature; the salaries of all officials should
be fixed, and perquisites of every kind withdrawn. Finally such
alterations should be made in the rates of postage, such post offices
established and such arrangements adopted for the regulation and
management of the service, as were called for by the joint address
of the two houses.</p>

<p>The plans elaborated by the British post office for the settlement
of the colonial difficulties found no more favour in Upper
Canada than in the other provinces. The assembly condemned
the draft bill as unworthy of consideration. The terms in which
the scheme was dismissed by the assembly were sufficiently slighting,
but the colonial secretary was not in the mood to be resentful.</p>

<p>Lord Glenelg was impressed with the substantial justice of the
claims of the assemblies in the two provinces, and would not make
a stand on a point of manners. As Sir Francis Bond Head was
about to come to Upper Canada to take up the lieutenant <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'govenorship'">governorship</ins>
in succession to Colbome, Glenelg, in his letter of instructions<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
directed Head to make every effort to bring the post office question
to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>Noticing the opinion given by the assembly on the postmaster
general's scheme of settlement, Glenelg thought it right to say
that the bill had the very careful consideration of the postmaster
general before being sent to the several provinces. The government,
however, had no desire to urge the adoption of any measure
to which well-founded objections existed. They were content
that the bill should be withdrawn, to make way for any better bill
that might be proposed by the house.</p>

<p>The assembly might find, on approaching the subject more
closely, continued Glenelg, that unexpected difficulties would crop
up, particularly with regard to intercourse by post with places
beyond the limits of the province. The lieutenant governor was
authorized to assent to any judicious and practicable measure
which the house might incorporate in a bill, and to regard as of no
importance, when opposed to the general convenience of the public,
any considerations of patronage or revenue derivable from this
source.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this conciliatory statement, the house proceeded
along the same lines as those followed by the assembly in
Lower Canada. They drew up a series of resolutions<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> providing
for the establishment of a post office department with headquarters
in Toronto. Specified sums were allotted for the maintenance
of a head office, and for the salaries of the postmaster
general and his staff. The rates were fixed on letters and newspapers,
and the percentage of revenue to be allowed postmasters
as salaries was defined.</p>

<p>The house was unsparing in its condemnation of Stayner.
They estimated that during the ten years preceding, the large
sum of £48,000 had been withdrawn from the province through
the exactions of the post office, an amount which they said would
have sufficed to establish five district banks, suited to the wants
of as many different sections of the country.</p>

<p>The advantages of a provincial establishment appeared to the
house to be very great. A large amount of wealth would be kept
in the province, which was sent to Quebec, either for transmission
to England, or to make up the perquisites of officials; post
offices could be opened wherever they were required, and no
distant part of the province would be without the means of cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and convenient accommodation; postmasters would be better
paid, and the postage on letters and newspapers would be reduced;
and extravagance could be checked and abuses corrected.</p>

<p>The house was fully aware of the objections to a local post
office system, but in their opinion those objections were not to
be mentioned beside the numerous advantages the provincial
post office would provide. It would be far easier for the department
to open accounts with the present or any other post office
department that might be organized, than it was to arrange with
the United States for the interchange of correspondence with that
country, and yet there was a very extensive exchange between
Canada and the United States without the aid of any law whatever.</p>

<p>In considering the terms of a post office bill, the house had
before it a list of conditions&mdash;thirty-one in number&mdash;which a
committee recommended for consideration. Many of these were
obvious. Others concerned matters of detail. Some were trivial.</p>

<p>One peculiar condition was that £100 a year should be allotted
for the purchase of books and instruments, which might be useful
in helping to keep the roads in a proper state of repair. The
plans for the establishment of a post office department in Upper
Canada did not reach completion, as the assembly was dissolved
a month after the resolutions were adopted, in consequence of its
refusal to vote supplies.</p>

<p>The termination of these agitations in the assemblies of Upper
and Lower Canada, mark the close of a period in the relations
between the provincial legislatures and the post office. The resolutions
which were directed against the constitutional status of the
post office, and the demands for separate provincial establishments
ceased at this point. This was due rather to the disappearance
of the opponents of the existing system than to the removal of
the causes for complaint.</p>

<p>The Lower Canadian assembly held a session of less than a
fortnight at the end of September and the beginning of October
1836, and another of a week in August 1837, when it was dissolved,
not to be resumed. During those sessions the affairs of the post
office were not mentioned. In Upper Canada the election, which
followed upon the dissolution of May 1836, resulted in a great
victory for the government party.</p>

<p>Before resuming the narrative of events in the British North
American provinces, it will be convenient to see how the late proceedings
were regarded by the home government. Lord Gosford,
the governor general, in transmitting to the colonial secretary the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
bill framed by the assembly of Lower Canada, observed that it
was intended as a substitute for the imperial bill of 1834, which
did not suit the ideas of the house.</p>

<p>One of the reasons adduced against the post office was that the
money which the deputy postmaster general sent to England was
the produce of an illegal tax levied in violation of the act of 1778.
In December 1835, some of the members of the assembly waited on
Gosford, and requested him to stop the remittance of about £3000
which was being made by Stayner to the department in England.</p>

<p>Gosford declined to take such a step for reasons which he set
forth. The members, also, asked that the governor should take
measures to recover from Stayner the sums which he was shown
to have taken as newspaper postage. Gosford replied that as
this allowance was permitted by the imperial department, and had
been sanctioned by the Duke of Richmond as late as 1831, he
could not assume to do what they asked, but he would bring the
subject to the attention of the home government.</p>

<p>The whole arrangement regarding newspapers appeared to
Gosford to be improper. He was of opinion that the emoluments
received by Stayner were unreasonably large, and that the practice
of allowing the deputy postmaster general to draw a considerable
private income from the public business was wrong in principle.</p>

<p>But the post office in London was already in possession of the
Lower Canadian bill. Stayner had sent a copy to the secretary
immediately on its adoption by the assembly, and before the
legislative council had had time to consider and reject it.</p>

<p>At the post office the receipt of the bill with the notice that it
would go into operation on the 1st of May, 1836, gave rise to great
perturbation among the officials. Freeling, in passing the bill
on to the postmaster general, declared it to be perhaps the most
important document he had ever received.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> It was neither more
nor less than an entire suppression of the postmaster general's
patent, and of the powers of an act of parliament, authorizing
the levying of certain rates of postage and the payment of the
amount of all such postages into His Majesty's exchequer.</p>

<p>Freeling was a very old man&mdash;he was born in 1764&mdash;on the
point of retiring from the charge, which he had held for forty-five
years, and it may be that he had forgotten that four years
before, the law officers had given it as their opinion that there was
no act of parliament giving the postmaster general authority over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the colonial post office and postages. At Freeling's instance the
postmaster general hastened to put the matter into the hands of
Glenelg, the colonial secretary. Having taken time to consider the
situation, the colonial office drew up a statement of the subject
for the attention of the postmaster general.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Observing that the assembly of Lower Canada, not being satisfied
with the imperial bill of 1834, had drawn up a bill of their
own, and that the legislative council, in declining to approve of
this bill, had asked the intervention of the home government with
the British parliament, the colonial secretary stated that the
British government was not prepared to accede to this proposition.</p>

<p>By the act of 1834, the regulation of the post office in the several
colonies was referred to the local legislatures, and His Majesty's
government, the colonial office concluded, could not call in the
authority of the imperial parliament for the solution of any difficulties
that may arise until it could be shown conclusively that
there were no other means of settling them; and then it would
be only with the concurrence of the legislatures to whom the
matter had been submitted.</p>

<p>But while determined that, in matters involving legislation,
the colonies should be left to work out their own salvation, the
colonial secretary observed that there were certain matters within
the competence of the postmaster general which, if given effect to,
would ameliorate the situation.</p>

<p>The legislative council had among their requests asked (1)
that all information required by the legislature should be furnished;
(2) that the accounts of receipts and expenditures should be laid
before the legislature annually; (3) that the officers of the department
should be placed on moderate fixed salaries, in lieu of all
perquisites and fees.</p>

<p>These objects, Glenelg pointed out, would have been to a certain
degree attained by the bill of 1834. But as it had not become
law, no time should be lost in putting these changes into effect,
as they did not require legislative sanction. The colonial secretary
also animadverted on the emoluments of Stayner. These
he considered entirely excessive, and besides they were levied on
an objectionable principle. The postmaster general was requested
to put an end forthwith to the receipt by the deputy postmaster
general of any fees on account of the transmission of newspapers.
His salary should not be excessive.</p>

<p>As a guide to the postmaster general in fixing it, the colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
secretary gave a list of the salaries of the principal officers in the
colony. Omitting that of the governor general, the highest salary
in Canada was that of the receiver general which was £1000 a year.
No other salary exceeded £500 a year. As against these, Stayner's
emoluments of £3185 for each of the three preceding years were
out of all proportion.</p>

<p>Glenelg further impressed upon the postmaster general the
anxiety of His Majesty's government that no time should be
lost in removing any real grievances which might be shown to
exist. The postmaster general concurred with Glenelg as to the
necessity of removing all reasonable grounds of complaint, and
stated that steps had been, or were about to be, taken to that
end.</p>

<p>To the postmaster general the newspaper postage question
was one of real difficulty, in view of the absence of necessary legislation.
As matters stood, newspapers could only be sent as letters
or under the deputy postmaster general's privilege. If the law
officers could see any way out of the difficulty, the postmaster
general would be glad to adopt it.</p>

<p>As the law officers' ingenuity was not equal to the difficulty,
the situation remained essentially unchanged for some years.
Meantime Stayner was enjoying to the full the peace and quiet
which followed upon the altered conditions in the two provincial
assemblies. It was some years since he had heard a complimentary
reference to himself in either house, though no man could have
shown more zeal for the improvement of the service he administered.</p>

<p>But an agreeable change was at hand. On February 17, 1837,
the legislative council of Upper Canada had before it the report
of a committee it had appointed to inquire into the post office.
The chairman of the committee was John Macaulay, formerly
postmaster of Kingston, and Stayner's chief support in Upper
Canada. When there was a question of appointing an assistant
deputy postmaster general for Upper Canada, it was Macaulay
that Stayner desired for the position.</p>

<p>The burden of the report of the committee of the council of
1837 was that the interests of the several provinces could be
maintained only by preserving to the post office its character as
an imperial institution. In Stayner's hands the service would be
carried on efficiently, now that he had been furnished with the
assistance he had applied for. Indeed the magnitude of his labour
could be understood only by those connected with the service.</p>

<p>The committee drew up a series of conditions which they considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
would place the institution on an efficient footing. The
conditions were very similar to those suggested by the legislative
council of Lower Canada in 1836. The bill of the Lower Canadian
assembly appeared to the committee to illustrate the impracticability
of any scheme such as that proposed by the imperial
government in 1834.</p>

<p>If the acceptance of a post office bill was left to the provincial
legislatures, they would almost certainly insist upon a scheme of
low rates, based entirely on local considerations. The excessively
reduced scale of rates proposed by the Lower Canadian assembly
could not fail to leave a large deficit. Hence the wisdom of leaving
the rates as they stood until their effects could be seen.</p>

<p>Ten days after the committee of the legislative council made
its report, the house of assembly adopted an address to the king,
in which the same ideas were embodied, and in the following month
a joint address was prepared by the assembly and the legislative
council.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The address began with a recital of the facts making up the
existing situation, and then proceeded to an effective criticism of
the imperial scheme of 1834. It pointed out that the colonial
secretary had stated that, in order to conform to the imperial
plans, a uniformity of views should pervade the bills passed by
the several provinces; that a careful consideration of the bill prepared
for the acceptance of the provinces, and of the action taken
upon it in the province discloses no reasonable grounds for the
hope that the legislatures would soon (if indeed ever) arrive at such
uniformity as would ensure the establishment of a practicable
system.</p>

<p>Even if such unanimity on the terms of a bill were reached,
it would doubtless happen frequently, the committee conceived,
that amendments in this bill would be necessary, but as all the
legislatures would have to be convinced of the necessity of the
amendments which seemed desirable or even indispensable to any
one of them, the difficulties in the way of making needful alterations
to meet the changing conditions in progressive communities
would be insuperable.</p>

<p>These conditions led inevitably to the conclusion on the part
of the committee that the only means of securing a practicable
system in which all interests, provincial and imperial, would be
considered, was to maintain the supremacy of the British post
office, and to continue to entrust to it the supreme power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
making laws and regulations for the management of the post
office in the several provinces. The interests of the provincial
legislatures would be amply safeguarded, the committee was
confident, if their demands for information respecting the post
office were acceded to, and if it were understood that complaints
against the deputy postmaster general, preferred by petition to
the legislature and supported by the joint address of the two
houses, would have the attention of the postmaster general in
London.</p>

<p>The turn which affairs had taken was naturally gratifying
to Stayner, who urged the postmaster general to give careful
heed to the terms of the joint address, which, if carried into
effect, would, in his opinion, provide a remedy for all warranted
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>The secretary of the post office did not share Stayner's hopefulness.
He observed to the postmaster general that, however
desirable uniformity of system might be in the post offices of
British North America, the success of any act of the imperial
parliament would be jeopardized, if it involved the imposition of
a tax upon the colonies. The secretary was prepared, however,
to listen to any suggestion Stayner might have to make in the way
of improving the existing system.</p>

<p>Although Stayner's friends were in control of both legislative
chambers in Upper Canada, his peace of mind on that account was
not of long duration. In April 1837, both houses passed a franking
act, under which the members were authorized to send their letters
free, during the sittings of the legislature. This act, as Stayner
pointed out to the postmaster general, subverted the imperial
acts, upon which the existence of the post office depended, and he
was placed in a very awkward situation.</p>

<p>Stayner, according to his letter to the postmaster general, had
either to violate the instructions from St. Martins-le-Grand or to
bring himself into collision with both the legislature and the
executive. This act appeared to Stayner to be a fresh illustration
of the unfitness of local legislatures to deal with an institution like
the post office. If part of the revenues could be withheld, as
would be the case where members did not pay their postage, any
of the legislatures might, by passing an act for the purpose, oblige
him to pay into the local treasury the whole of the revenue which
came into his hands, or it might in any other way supersede the
laws of the British parliament.</p>

<p>The bill had received the assent of the governor. Constitutionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
it had thereby become an act. But on Stayner's remonstrance
the governor admitted to the colonial office that he should
not have given his sanction to it. The act was disallowed by the
home government.</p>

<p>The question of franking the correspondence of the provincial
governments and of the members of the legislatures was one upon
which the legislatures in the several provinces had particularly
strong convictions. For a considerable period before 1837, the
legislatures of Upper and Lower Canada had not paid their accounts
for postage.</p>

<p>The account against Upper Canada, which amounted to £1629,
was paid in the beginning of 1837; while the account against
Lower Canada was not paid until after the dissolution of the last
assembly at the time of the rebellion. It amounted to £4043.</p>

<p>The governor general, Gosford, in reporting the payment of the
account of Lower Canada, suggested to the colonial secretary that
the sum might be remitted as an act of grace on the part of the
imperial government, and he urged that if the home government
should not feel warranted in making this concession in its entirety,
the correspondence of the governor general and his civil secretary,
which embraced all the executive business of the province, might
be exempt from postage charges.</p>

<p>Gosford's suggestions were in harmony with the whole character
of his administration. Indeed his persistence in his policy of
conciliation brought down upon him the distrust of the ultra-Loyalists.</p>

<p>Stayner, to whom Gosford's suggestion was referred, opposed
it vigorously. If, he argued, this concession were made to Lower
Canada, immediate demands of the same character would be made
by the other provinces. This would be followed by requests for
the free transmission of members' correspondence, and the post
office would speedily find itself in a deficit.</p>

<p>It would be specially inadvisable to grant this privilege to
Lower Canada, Stayner averred, as the postage received from that
province, after deducting the British packet postage, which was
the admitted due of the British post office, barely sufficed to pay
the expenses of the service in the province. The revenues from
Upper Canada exceeded the expenses by a considerable sum, and
any extension of the advantages now enjoyed by Lower Canada,
would be at the expense of the upper province.</p>

<p>The first of the annual statements of revenue and expenditure
for which the legislatures had been contending for many years was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
presented to the legislatures on the 17th of January, 1838. The
statement contained an undivided account of the operations in
Upper and Lower Canada. This was not quite satisfactory to the
house in Upper Canada, but as the services for the conveyance of
the mails ran from one province into the other, it was impossible
to assign accurately to each province its share of the expense for
their maintenance.</p>

<p>As the statement showed a surplus of £11,264 for the years 1836-1837,
the legislature of Upper Canada saw no reason for hesitating
to press its demand that the franking privilege be granted to
its members. They went, indeed, much further, and asked that
the whole amount of the surplus revenue, which arose from the
post office business in Upper Canada, be transferred to them.</p>

<p>In support of their request, the legislature pointed out that,
in the imperial act of 1834, it was provided that as soon as the
consent of His Majesty should be signified to the bills of the several
colonial legislatures, the net revenue from the post office in British
North America should be distributed among the several provinces
in the proportion indicated by their gross revenues; that the
suspension of the legislature in Lower Canada, in consequence of
the rebellion, made it impossible to procure joint legislative enactments;
and the financial condition of Upper Canada made it
necessary that the province should have at its disposal all the
means to which it was legally entitled.</p>

<p>The terms of this memorial were entirely in accord with
Stayner's views as to the proper settlement of this long standing
difficulty, and he urged the postmaster general to do what was
possible to give effect to the petition. He pointed out that, with
Mackenzie and Papineau out of the country, and fugitives from
justice, there was no further disposition on the part of the legislatures
to wrest from the imperial post office the control of the
postal systems in the provinces, and that the appropriation of the
surplus revenues to provincial purposes removed the only valid
argument against existing arrangements.</p>

<p>The postmaster general, however, was not to be moved from
the position he had taken. He replied to the address stating that
no disposition could be made of the surplus post office revenues,
until the several colonial governments had come to an agreement
on the subject.</p>

<p>The long controversy which had agitated the legislatures of the
provinces was approaching its end. The decision on the constitutional
point was given in their favour, though they did not know
it; but the specific thing for which they had contended, they were
constrained to relinquish.</p>

<p>The Upper Canada legislature which had commenced the
agitation, and elaborated the argument against the constitutional
standing of the British post office in the colonies, had become
convinced that the provincial system, which they demanded, was
not in the interest of either the mother country or the colonies.
They therefore asked the British government to put the stamp of
legality on the existing system, by suitable legislation in the
imperial parliament.</p>

<p>But the argument of Upper Canada had done its work too well,
and it became the turn of the British government to employ it,
to show the impossibility of meeting the desires of Upper Canada.
The difficulty now, however, was not one of principle, but of ways
and means.</p>

<p>The British government were quite willing that the colonial
legislatures should have full information as to the financial operations
of their post offices, and that the surplus revenue, if any,
should be divided among them. All they required was that the
colonial legislatures should by concurrent action devise the means
by which the ends in view might be effected. The British parliament
was, in the opinion of the law officers, precluded from interposing
its authority in the settlement of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Durham, who was sent out to Canada as high commissioner
to inquire into, and, if possible, remedy the defects in the system
of government, which kept the colonies in a chronic state of dissatisfaction,
was directed to give his attention to the condition of
affairs in the post office.</p>

<p>In his general report, he dealt briefly with this topic, expressing
full sympathy with the colonial view, and giving it as his opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
that if his proposition for a union of the provinces should be adopted
the control of the post office should be given up to the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
But he added the recommendation that, whatever arrangements
of a political nature might be made, the management of the post
office throughout the whole of British North America should be
conducted by one general establishment. This suggestion was not
realized until the confederation of the provinces in 1867.</p>

<p>The rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada in 1837 and the
following year was productive of much embarrassment to the post
office. Many of the postmasters, particularly in Lower Canada,
were open sympathisers with the rebels, and, through the opportunities
afforded by their post office duties, assisted largely in the
carrying out of their leaders' schemes.</p>

<p>Stayner had realized the impolicy of many of the appointments
to post offices in Lower Canada. But as the local government
was continually appointing to the highest offices men who were
conspicuous in the support they lent to the views of Papineau, he
did not conceive himself warranted in noticing facts which were
ignored by the governor.</p>

<p>There were at least from thirty to forty postmasters besides
several mail couriers in Lower Canada implicated in the rebellion.
The governor general in Lower Canada, and the lieutenant governor
in Upper Canada gave their attention to the conditions, each after
his manner.</p>

<p>Gosford, the governor general, having been informed of the
disloyalty of the postmasters at Stanstead and Lacolle, suggested
that these officials should be dismissed as soon as it could be done
without prejudice to the service.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Bond Head, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, directed
the local surveyor to dismiss the postmaster at Lloydtown instantly,
for having, as he said, sent to Mackenzie a series of traitorous
resolutions to which the postmaster had attached his name as
corresponding secretary of the West King and Tecumseth Political
Union. Head explained to Stayner that he was aware that the
usual course was to have the dismissal made by the deputy postmaster
general, but as he desired to produce a certain moral effect
by instant punishment, he was compelled to act through Stayner's
agent.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Bond Head asked that Stayner should delegate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to Berezy, the surveyor, the power to dismiss peremptorily any
person connected with the post office whom the lieutenant governor
should judge to have failed in loyalty. Head was an arbitrary
personage, who never gladly suffered the execution of his wishes
to linger after their utterance.</p>

<p>A painful instance of the hardships inflicted upon innocent
men in times of political turmoil was the dismissal of Howard, the
postmaster of Toronto.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> His offence was not disloyalty. Even
Bond Head would not venture to say that he was disloyal&mdash;but
merely that his friendships were so far inclusive as to embrace
men of widely differing political opinions.</p>

<p>James Howard had been connected with the post office in
Toronto for eighteen years, during eight of which he had been
postmaster. Testimony abounded as to his zeal and efficiency as
a public official. Stayner reported to the postmaster general that
Howard was a man of excellent character, and one of the best
officers in the service.</p>

<p>An aspect of Howard's conduct, which won Stayner's warm
commendation, was his withholding himself from all forms of
political activity. "People in our department," wrote Stayner
to Howard, some years before, "cannot too carefully abstain from
identifying themselves with factions or parties of any kind."</p>

<p>Secure in the approbation of his chief, Howard, following his
natural inclination, moved quietly through the troubled times,
which were heading for an outbreak, and delivered the letters to
Loyalist and Reformer, to Tory and Radical, with even-handed
indifference. It would seem, too, that in the choice of his friends,
he exhibited a like insensibility to the explosive possibilities of
some of their opinions.</p>

<p>A few days after the public disturbances began, it was intimated
to Howard that his general attitude towards affairs was not quite
satisfactory, and he at once demanded an investigation. There
was nothing to investigate. But a hint was conveyed to him that
he was too intimate with "those people."</p>

<p>It was decided to have the correspondence of suspects placed
under surveillance. But the duty was not confided to Howard.
Letters supposed to contain information of the rebels were sent
to the bank of Upper Canada, where they were subjected to
scrutiny.</p>

<p>On December 13, 1837, eight days after the rebellion broke out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
at Montgomery's Tavern, Toronto, Howard was removed from his
office by the orders of the lieutenant governor. He was replaced by
Berezy, the post office inspector, who throughout the rebellion was
active as the confidential agent of Bond Head. Howard appealed
to the lieutenant governor, protesting his perfect loyalty, and
declaring that so far from concerning himself with politics, he had
never voted in his life.</p>

<p>No statement could have been more unfortunate. Head,
always a partisan, was unable to understand how a man could
suppose himself to be loyal, and confess to such a degree of indifference,
when the safety of the country was at stake. The
admonition of the deputy postmaster general was pleaded. Bond
Head would not listen. Friends of the government, of the tried
qualities of Fitzgibbon, vouched for Howard's loyalty. It was to
no purpose.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor declared that he had his reasons for
believing, not only that Howard favoured the disaffected party,
but that he had actually become "subservient to the execution of
the treasonable plans." No evidence has ever been produced to
support these accusations. But Head, in his flamboyant style,
prated about the struggle being waged between monarchy and
democracy, and contrasted Howard's indifference with the zealous
devotion of the chief justice and one of the judges, who, shedding
the ermine, took up their muskets in the defence of the country&mdash;and
their jobs and perquisites.</p>

<p>Head indulged himself in several similar excesses of authority,
always justifying himself on the ground that he was a protagonist
in a death struggle with the arch-enemy Democracy. When quiet
was restored, Howard renewed his appeals for redress, but the
clique surrounding the governor contrived to frustrate all his efforts
in that direction.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1839, a robbery of the mails took place on
the grand route, at a point between Kingston and Gananoque,
under circumstances of peculiar aggravation.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The robbers, who
lived on an island in the St. Lawrence, within the territory of
the state of New York, made no attempt at concealment. They
openly declared that this was only the first of a series of similar
interferences with the courier passing between Upper and Lower
Canada.</p>

<p>The New York state authorities, who were appealed to, were
powerless to act, but the secretary of state at Albany intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
that it would not be regarded as a breach of amity if the Canadian
officials arrested the robbers on the island. In view, however, of
the excitement which prevailed at that period on both sides of the
border, it was thought prudent to refrain from so provocative a
proceeding.</p>

<p>While Durham was occupied with his preparations for his
mission to Canada, events occurred which were not only of unsurpassed
importance to communication between Europe and
America, but which seemed to promise a strengthening of the
relations between the mother country and her colonies.</p>

<p>In April 1838, two steamships sailed from the United Kingdom
for New York&mdash;the "Great Western" from Bristol, and the "Sirius"
from Cork&mdash;and reached their destination safely, the former in
fifteen days, and the latter in seventeen days.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>As the voyages were made in the face of stiff, westerly winds,
the speed of the "Great Western" and the "Sirius" gave much satisfaction,
and it was accepted as settled that thereafter steam would
be the motive power in the faster vessels employed in the transatlantic
trade.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which this conviction established itself was
remarkable. There is nothing surprising in the immediate
recognition of this new achievement of steam by speculative
publicists, who saw in the events only the realization of their
visions, but the British treasury, the arcanum of conservative
caution, yielded with almost equal readiness to the argument
provided by the two vessels.</p>

<p>The British consul at New York was the first to bring to official
attention the importance of this advance in the art of navigation.
By the return of one of the vessels, he suggested to the colonial
office that all official despatches and commercial letters for the
Canadas should be directed to the consulate at New York. He
undertook to assort the correspondence, and forward it to Montreal
and Toronto by queen's messengers.</p>

<p>By avoiding the delays to which the regular couriers were
subject, and taking advantage, wherever possible, of the steamboats
running on the inland waters and of the railroads, which were
beginning to be constructed throughout the eastern states, the
messengers would be able to provide a greatly accelerated service.
The answers to letters sent from London or Liverpool to Canada
should be back in those cities in from thirty to thirty-five days&mdash;approximately
the time taken by the Halifax packets on a single trip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The British post office saw reasons for declining the proposal,
so far as it regarded commercial correspondence. It was, however,
prepared to transmit official despatches by this means, and to
arrange for their conveyance from New York in the manner indicated
by the consul.</p>

<p>The people of Halifax&mdash;who had always regarded with a jealous
eye the disposition of the inland British colonies, to use the port
of New York in preference to their own&mdash;managed, at this juncture
in the history of ocean transport, by an appeal to imperial considerations
to make a strong case for their port. By a happy
chance, the "Sirius" on its first homeward voyage, overtook the mail
packet from Halifax, and the captain of the packet, impressed by
the higher speed of the steam vessel, induced the captain of the
"Sirius" to take the mails, with the result that their arrival was
advanced by several days.</p>

<p>Joseph Howe and some other gentlemen from the Maritime
provinces who happened to be passengers on the sailing packet
when this incident occurred, were struck with this demonstration
of the superiority of steam, and discussed among themselves
whether this fact might not indicate the means of overcoming, in
favour of Halifax, the advantage enjoyed by the port of New York.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Howe in London, a meeting was called of men
interested in the subject, and it was resolved to press their views
on the attention of the government. Several of the gentlemen
wrote to the colonial secretary, and a memorial of a more formal
character was submitted, bearing the signatures of Howe, as
representative of Nova Scotia, and of William Crane, a member
of the legislature of New Brunswick, as representative of that
province.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The views and arguments were of a character similar to those
employed by imperial federation leagues since that period&mdash;the
shorter sea voyage, the fostering of common interests among the
provinces, and the desirability of an interchange within the
empire of news and correspondence, uncontaminated by passage
through a foreign channel.</p>

<p>At that period, the last of these points had a peculiar timeliness.
The rebellion in Upper Canada had just been subdued,
but the embers were ready to blaze up afresh with the first favouring
breeze; while in Lower Canada the outbreak was still unchecked.
The fast sailing packets on the New York-Liverpool route so far
outsailed the post office packets which ran to Halifax, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
news carried by way of New York was sometimes weeks in advance
of that which arrived by the Halifax packets.</p>

<p>As American popular sympathies, as distinct from official
sympathy at Washington and Albany, lay mainly with the rebels,
and as newspaper publishers were in general less scrupulous as to
the veracity of their news than they are to-day, it often happened
that the British public, and even the government in Downing
Street, were grossly misled as to the movement of events in the
Canadas. The truth reached England eventually, but it had the
proverbial difficulty in catching up with the nimble fiction, which
had earlier circulation.</p>

<p>In September the treasury made its decision.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> In the early
part of that month, the Great Western Steamship Company, which
was organized in 1836 for the purpose of providing a steam service
between Great Britain and America, and which had been for some
months past demonstrating the entire feasibility of this class of
service, applied to the government for a contract for the conveyance
of the mails to New York.</p>

<p>But the plea of Howe and Crane for a direct service prevailed.
On September 24 the treasury announced the substitution of
steam vessels for the sailing packets on the Halifax route, and
directed that tenders should be invited for such a service as the
admiralty and post office considered most suitable.</p>

<p>The treasury deprecated the haste with which the plans were
being pushed forward, suggesting that a winter's experience would
be valuable in dealing with so important a matter. But there
were strong reasons for avoiding unnecessary delay. Relations
with the United States were causing some anxiety, and as regards
transatlantic correspondence, that country stood in a position of
advantage, which it seemed the business of Great Britain to equalize
as far as possible.</p>

<p>Tenders were invited for a steam packet service between Liverpool
and Halifax in November. But none of those submitted
satisfied the conditions prescribed by the government. Samuel
Cunard, of Halifax, who had had a large experience as a contractor
for packet services, visited England, and as the result of negotiations,
entered into a contract with the admiralty.</p>

<p>The contract called for two trips monthly each way between
Liverpool and Halifax, and for trips of the same frequency between
Halifax and Boston, and between Pictou on the gulf of St. Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and Quebec: the vessels to be employed to be of three hundred
horse power for the transatlantic service, and of one hundred and
fifty horse power for the other two routes. The contract was signed
on May 4, 1839, the rate of payment being £55,000 a year.</p>

<p>This rate underwent a rapid series of augmentations. Two
months after the contract was made £5000 a year was added to
the rate on consideration that the vessels should leave the
American ports, as well as Liverpool, on fixed dates. On September
1, 1841, the decision was reached that vessels of a larger size
than in the service should be employed, and to secure these the
rate was raised to £80,000.</p>

<p>Two years later, in consequence of representations by the contractors
that the amount of payment was insufficient to enable
them to carry on the service, £10,000 was added to the subsidy;
and further additions were made as the result of changes in the
arrangements, which will be detailed in their proper place.</p>

<p>In addition to the provision for the exchange of mails by the
Cunard steamers, between Great Britain and Canada and the
United States, arrangements were made for subsidiary services
to Newfoundland and Bermuda. Halifax, indeed, was being made
the pivotal point of the most extensive scheme ever attempted
for the distribution of mails. All the communications between
Great Britain and the North American continent were comprised
in the plans.</p>

<p>The first trip by steamer between Liverpool and Halifax was
made by the "Britannia," which left Liverpool on July 1, 1840.
The vessel reached Halifax after a passage of twelve and a half
days. The mails for Canada were carried overland from Halifax
to Pictou, from which point they were delivered at Quebec five and
a half days after their landing at Halifax. As the vessel conveying
the mails up the St. Lawrence from Pictou to Quebec was delayed
a day in the gulf by fog, there was reason for hope that the passage
from Liverpool to Quebec would not materially exceed fifteen
days.</p>

<p>The post office authorities at Halifax bent every effort to make
the enterprise a success. As an instance of their zealous energy,
the "Britannia," on its September sailing, reached Halifax on a
morning at seven o'clock. At a quarter to nine the mails for Canada
were on their way to Pictou; at ten the "Britannia" set out
for Boston; and by noon the vessels for Newfoundland and
Bermuda had left for their destinations.</p>

<p>Prince Edward Island did not at once enjoy the full benefits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of these efficient operations, but by a slight improvement in the
arrangements, the island was put on an equal footing with the
other colonies.</p>

<p>The scheme, however, admirable as it was in conception, and
successful as it appeared to be in operation, had weaknesses,
which were revealed by time&mdash;weaknesses which before many years
led to its abandonment.</p>

<p>The test of the success of such a scheme lay in its capability
to provide adequately for the exchanges with Canada. The mails
to and from Upper and Lower Canada were not only much greater
in volume than those exchanged with the other provinces, but
owing to the existing political conditions in the Canadas, were at
the time of greater importance; and, if, owing to any lack of co-operation
on the part of the provinces participating in the transmission
of the mails between Halifax and Quebec, or through
other causes, these mails required a notably greater length of time
in their passage by the Halifax route than they would have taken
if landed at a port in the United States, the Halifax route must
be considered a failure.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happened. When the British government
decided to give the scheme a trial, it reminded the provinces
concerned that there were several months in every year when the
mails must be carried between Halifax and Quebec overland, and
that this could be done successfully only if the roads in Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec, over which the mails must
pass, were put in a condition to permit of fast travel by carriage,
night as well as day.</p>

<p>At the time&mdash;1840&mdash;the steamships began to run to Halifax,
the situation as regards the land routes was as follows: the distance
from Halifax to Quebec&mdash;seven hundred miles&mdash;was rarely covered
by the mail couriers in less than ten days. In the depth of winter,
when the sleighing was good, and advantage could be taken of the
ice road on the St. John river between Fredericton and the mouth
of the Madawaska river, the journey was made in some hours less
than six days.</p>

<p>But it was seldom that conditions combined to make so fast
a journey possible, and it was not considered prudent to reckon
on an average of less than ten days. In the spring and autumn
this length of time was often greatly exceeded. Stayner, who
went over the route in the autumn of 1838, after calculating the
effect of all practicable ameliorations, did not believe that the time
could be reduced to less than seven days. As against this possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
time, there was the fact that the journey from New York to Quebec
occupied only six and a half days in winter.</p>

<p>The farther west the point of comparison was carried, moreover,
the greater the disadvantage at which Halifax stood. The
shortest time to be anticipated in conveying the mails from Halifax
to Montreal, after all improvements had been made, was nine
days. The courier from New York, who had but half the distance
to travel, delivered his mails in Montreal in five days. Toronto,
the capital of Upper Canada, and the entrepôt for the thriving
and rapidly-spreading settlements in the west, was still more
easily reached from New York than from Halifax. The journey
from Halifax to Toronto covered a distance of one thousand two
hundred and twelve miles, and occupied more than two weeks.
New York was only five hundred and forty miles from Toronto,
and the mails were carried between the two places in seven days
in winter.</p>

<p>Halifax is five hundred and fifty miles nearer Liverpool than is
New York, and consequently gained two days on the ocean voyage.
But, in point of time, the odds were hopelessly against Halifax, as
the landing port for the Canadian mails. The obvious political
reasons, however, for maintaining Halifax as the port of exchange
between the North American provinces, as a whole, and the mother
country, provoked a determined effort to remove, as far as possible,
the natural obstacles which seemed to prevent the achievement of
that end.</p>

<p>Inquiry was directed first to the question of the best route.
From Halifax to Fredericton, the first important point at which
the courier arrived on his western journey, there were alternative
routes, both of which had been used in the conveyance of
the mails to Canada. Since the war of 1812, the courier had
travelled along the northern shore of the bay of Fundy, passing
Truro, Dorchester and the bend of the Petitcodiac, now Moncton.</p>

<p>This route was adopted first to avoid the necessity of the mails
crossing the bay of Fundy from Annapolis to St. John, with the
risks of falling in with American privateers, but after the termination
of the war, it was continued from choice.</p>

<p>The earlier route, from Halifax to Windsor and along the
Annapolis valley to Annapolis, still had its advocates, however;
and inquiry was made as to the advisability of returning to it.
Under certain ideal conditions, a better journey could be made by
this route, but as these involved heavy additional expense, and a
nicety of connection between the couriers and the packet boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
at Annapolis, which was frequently unattainable, the proposition
was rejected.</p>

<p>The real difficulties for the courier began when he left Fredericton
on his journey to Quebec. The route lay along the shore of
the St. John river to the point where the Madawaska empties into
it; thence in a generally northern direction until the St. Lawrence
is reached at the head of the portage.</p>

<p>At this period&mdash;1840&mdash;there was no road whatever over any
part of this section of the route, though in 1839, a road called the
Royal Road was in course of construction between Fredericton
and Grand Falls. The schemes for the building of a road
were embarrassed by the fact that for nearly one hundred miles,
the proposed road lay in the territory claimed by the state of
Maine, with the resulting risk that the expenditure upon it might
be lost.</p>

<p>The only mode of travel from Fredericton northward to the
mouth of the Madawaska was by canoe in summer. In the winter,
when the ice was well set, travel was very easy. But during the
early spring and late autumn, the floating ice made the journey
in this part of the country one of great hardship. On a trip made
in April 1842, it required three men and twelve horses to carry
over this section a mail weighing not more than seven or eight
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The Special Council of Quebec, which was in existence in 1838-1840,
owing to the suppression of the legislature due to suspension
of the constitution of 1791 in Lower Canada, at the urgent instance
of Sydenham, appropriated £5000 for a road over the portage
between the St. Lawrence and the St. John rivers. The legislature
of New Brunswick also made a liberal grant for the section lying
in that province.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that Halifax stood at an insurmountable
disadvantage as compared with the New York route during the
winter season. But, at least so far as concerned eastern Canada,
the provincial route was not greatly inferior to that through the
United States, during the period of open navigation on the St.
Lawrence. The passage from Liverpool to Quebec did not usually
exceed sixteen days, and to Montreal eighteen days.</p>

<p>An essential link in this conveyance was the overland route
from Halifax to Pictou. As this service furnished the connection
between the steamers on the Atlantic and those on the St. Lawrence,
it was of the first importance that the route should be traversed
at a high rate of speed. The route had been in use for many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
for the exchange of local mails, but the means of conveyance, which
were sufficient for that purpose, were entirely inadequate to the
requirements of the ocean mail service.</p>

<p>Cunard&mdash;who had every motive for expediting not only the
mails, but the passengers and freight passing to and from the
Canadas&mdash;drew attention to the necessity for ample provision for
the new conditions. Unless he were able to afford a fast and
comfortable conveyance at a moderate charge to his Canadian
passengers, he could not hope to hold the business. As it was
desirable that he should be able to exercise control over this part
of the passage, he offered to provide the service between Halifax
and Pictou on terms, which were accepted by the deputy postmaster
general of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The service afforded left little to be desired in point of efficiency.
Four horse stages ran over the route three times each way weekly
in summer, and twice weekly in winter; the trip was to be made
within seventeen hours, and the charge to passengers was not to
exceed £2 10<i>s</i>. The charge for each person had been, until the
contract was made, £6.</p>

<p>But accommodation such as this necessarily entailed considerable
expense, and the compensation to Cunard under the contract
was so great as seriously to embarrass the financial position of the
post office in Nova Scotia. This amount&mdash;£1550 per annum&mdash;was
£1265 in excess of what had been paid for this route before the
British mails were carried over it.</p>

<p>The revenues of the provincial post office were quite unequal
to this demand upon, them, and relief was sought from the legislature.
That body agreed to contribute £550, and Canada was
asked to add £750 to that sum. When Howe reported the facts
to the postmaster general, the latter was disposed to tax him with
having acted without consideration, and Sydenham was asked to
give his opinion of the bargain.</p>

<p>The governor general laid the subject before the post office
commission, which was then sitting, and they denounced the whole
arrangement. The rate was extravagant, and the service provided
for was entirely beyond the necessities of the ocean mails. As
the steamers were to sail only twice a month, an express conveyance
of that frequency was all that was required.</p>

<p>As for Canada's being at any expense for this service, the
commission scouted the idea. The Cunard contract called for the
transportation of mails between Great Britain and Canada, which
was to be effected by two steamers, one running between Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and Halifax, and the other between Pictou and Quebec.
Any expense there might be for overland conveyance should fall
upon the packet postage, that is, it should be a charge upon the
postage collected by the British post office for the transmission
of letters between Great Britain and Canada.</p>

<p>The British post office took a somewhat curious course in the
difficulty. It resented the criticism of the commissioners, and
sanctioned the agreement made by the deputy in Halifax, for a
term of eight years. It made no effort to convince the Canadian
authorities of the error in their views, which would indeed have
been impossible; and, on the other hand, it refused to allow the
additional expense to be thrown upon the packet postage. There
was but one alternative&mdash;Nova Scotia must bear the whole charge.
And that was the decision of the postmaster general.</p>

<p>The resentment throughout Nova Scotia at the injustice of
this decision, and the manifest inability of the provincial post
office to carry the added burden determined the postmaster general
to make an effort to put an end to the situation. In 1842 he sent
an officer of the department to Halifax to inquire into the whole
provincial system, instructing him to give his special attention
to the question of the expediency of continuing the use of the
port of Halifax as the entrepôt for the Canadian mails.</p>

<p>The thing to be avoided was the long carriage by land, and the
agent was directed to consider the ports of St. John, New Brunswick
and Boston with this end in view. Boston was regarded
with particular favour on account of the railway lines, which were
being extended inland from that port. St. John was dismissed
from consideration on a report from the admiralty that until
some progress had been made in the survey of the bay of Fundy,
especially of its tides and soundings, it would be very hazardous
to send the mails by that route.</p>

<p>On the question of the comparative advantages of the Halifax
and Boston routes there was practical unanimity in Canada. All
classes of the mail-using public were agreed as to the superiority
of the Boston route. The editors of newspapers complained that
the British newspapers on which they depended for their foreign
news&mdash;newspapers which were transmitted by way of Halifax&mdash;were
useless by the time they reached Canada, as the news they
contained had been received from New York or Boston several
days earlier.</p>

<p>As for the objection to having the exchange of mails between
Great Britain and Canada carried on through a foreign country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the publishers made light of it. The mails from England for India,
were carried across the Continent through France and Italy;
and there was no reason why the mails from England for Canada
should not be carried through the United States.</p>

<p>These views were strongly presented by Stayner, and reinforced
by the secretary of the post office, who laid them before the postmaster
general. The Cunards also rendered assistance to the
same end. They represented to the postmaster general that the
service proved to be much more expensive than they had anticipated
when they undertook the contract, and that the steamer
on the St. Lawrence was a very heavy burden. In discussing
the question of an increased subsidy, the company expressed their
willingness to regard relief from the river service as equivalent
to £10,000 a year.</p>

<p>These concurrent appeals, together with the fact that the
change in the seat of government from Kingston to Montreal,
established the governor in the city which would derive the
maximum of benefit from the Boston connection, decided the
government to make Boston the landing port for the Canadian
mails; and the British minister at Washington was instructed
to open negotiations for an arrangement by which the British mails
would be permitted to cross the territory of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>It had long been an object of desire with the United States
government to retain the hold its geographical situation has
given it upon the correspondence between Great Britain and
Canada. Before steam service was a practicable scheme, the
president in a message to congress suggested that, to that end,
the sailing packets should be put under post office regulations,
and a greater degree of security to the mails thereby effected.</p>

<p>The United States government consequently were prepared to
accept very moderate terms. They based their offer on the terms
of the contract between the British and French governments for
the conveyance of the Indian mails from Calais on the Channel to
Marseilles on the Mediterranean. The British government paid
the French government two francs per ounce of letters and ten
centimes for each newspaper transmitted across French territory,
and as the distance from Boston to St. Johns in Lower Canada
was rather less than half that from Calais to Marseilles, they proposed
that the British government should pay them half the
rates paid to the French government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>These rates were regarded by the postmaster general of England
as unusually favourable, and the proposal of the United States
government was at once accepted. Under this arrangement, the
postmaster general calculated that, besides the great saving in
time that would be effected, there would be a reduction in the
charges for the inland conveyance of the mails to and from Canada
of £4600 per annum.</p>

<p>The course of conveyance across the territory of the United
States was to be, in summer, from Boston to Burlington, Vermont,
towards which a railway line was approaching completion, and
from Burlington to St. Johns by steamer on lake Champlain. In
the winter, the mails were to be carried from Boston to Highgate,
Vermont, where they would be taken over by couriers attached
to the Canadian post office. The time occupied would, under
usual conditions, be forty-eight hours between Boston and St.
Johns, and fifty-three hours between Boston and Highgate.</p>

<p>Thus was the great experiment brought to its appointed end.
It had its origin in one of those imperial impulses, which seem
to come most frequently from the colonies, and which now and
then carry the Briton off his feet. But, as conditions stood, the
scheme was foredoomed to failure. It was not until the construction
of the Canadian Pacific railway in 1889, across the state of
Maine between Montreal and St. John, that a Canadian ocean
port was able to enter into successful competition with a United
States port, as the point of exchange for mails passing between
Great Britain and Canada.</p>

<p>While the plans for substituting steam for sailing vessels were
being brought to maturity, the question of a substantial reduction
in the postage between Great Britain and the colonies in North
America were being discussed.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Stayner pointed out that it would
be useless to enter upon an expensive scheme for reducing the time
occupied in conveying the mails between Great Britain and
Canada, unless the postage were brought down to a figure that
would place the steamship service within reach of the farmers
in western Canada.</p>

<p>As Sydenham observed, the new settlers, while living in great
material comfort, had little money at their disposal. To them
it was an impossibility to pay the postage&mdash;four shillings or more&mdash;which
had accumulated on a letter on its way from the inland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
parts of the United Kingdom to the backwoods in which they
were making homes for themselves. They were served, and far
from inefficiently, by the American ocean sailing packets, which
left Liverpool weekly for New York; and unless the steam line
were able to provide for the exchange of their letters at rates as
low as they were paying, they would no more patronize the new
line than they had the ten-gun sailing brigs, by which the British
packet service was then carried on.</p>

<p>Stayner, with full knowledge of the conditions he had to meet,
was convinced that the first step towards an effective reform was
to sweep away the cumulative rates made up of the inland charges
in the United Kingdom, the ocean postage and the inland colonial
charge; and replace them by one fixed rate which would carry
the letter from any post office in the United Kingdom to any
post office in the colonies. When he first laid the proposition
before the postmaster general, the Duke of Richmond, he recommended
that this uniform rate should be two shillings a single letter.</p>

<p>But after some years' opportunity for reflection, aided beyond
doubt by the argument of Rowland Hill for penny postage in
Great Britain, Stayner concluded that his proposed rate was too
high, and that, at one shilling and sixpence, or even one shilling
and threepence, the increased patronage of the line by the public
in the motherland and the colonies, would bring about an actual
augmentation of the revenue.</p>

<p>How great the reduction in the charges would be, if Stayner's
proposition were carried into effect, may be gathered from the
fact that one of the elements making up the total postage was
much in excess of the whole sum suggested by Stayner. On
the supposition that the steamships landed the Canadian mails
at Halifax, every letter brought by that means to Toronto would
be subject to a charge of two shillings and ninepence for the conveyance
from Halifax to Toronto, to say nothing of the shilling
charge for its passage from Liverpool to Halifax, and the postage
from the office of posting in the United Kingdom to Liverpool.</p>

<p>While negotiations with Cunard were still in progress, and the
colonies waited expectantly for what was to be achieved by the
new service, Stayner was much surprised and gratified to receive
from the general post office in London a circular addressed to
the postmasters in the United Kingdom stating that the postmaster
general had decided to do away altogether with the inland
rate or rather to incorporate it with the ocean rate which thenceforward
would be one shilling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>This was beyond any anticipations Stayner had formed, and
he lost no time in apprizing the public in Canada of the boon
conferred upon them. There was rejoicing in Canada over the
prospect of easy communication with the mother country, and the
postmaster general received many commendations on his statesmanlike
measure.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>But the rejoicing was not of long continuance. With the
first intimation at the general post office of the announcement
made in Canada there was despatched a letter from the secretary
informing Stayner that he had quite mistaken the purport of the
circular. Though sent to Stayner for his information, it was not
intended to apply to Canada. The intention was merely to take
off the British inland postage, and to leave the colonial inland
postage to be collected as before. The reduction, in reality,
amounted to very little, as the bulk of the postage on letters from
Great Britain to Canada passing by way of Halifax had been that
part levied for the conveyance from Halifax to the office of delivery
in Canada.</p>

<p>Stayner was in no way to blame for the interpretation he
placed on the circular, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that
his misconception made the continuance of the high postage
impossible. The public on both sides of the ocean had tasted
the blessings of communication with their relatives on the other
side, at an expense not considered beyond their means, and they
were determined not to have the benefit withdrawn.</p>

<p>Accordingly when Poulett Thomson, afterwards Earl of Sydenham,
came out as governor general with special instructions to
remove all legitimate causes of dissatisfaction, he addressed himself
to this question, and after a conference with Stayner, wrote to
the colonial secretary urging the adoption of the shilling rate.</p>

<p>The colonial secretary submitted the governor general's views
to the postmaster general, and in practical coincidence with the
sailing of the first steamer under the Cunard contract, instructions
were issued to make the total charge on letters to the British North
American colonies one shilling, if the letter was addressed to
Halifax, and one shilling and twopence, if its destination was
inland, however distant.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, a change of great importance was made in
the principle on which the postage was based. It had been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
practice to charge postage, according to the number of enclosures
the letter contained. When penny postage was introduced in
England a few months previously, one of the features of the new
plan was the establishment of the weight principle in determining
the charge on a letter, in substitution of the principle under which
letters were taxed according to the number of their contents.</p>

<p>The operation of the new plan in Great Britain caused much
confusion and loss in the correspondence with the colonies. The
British or Irish people, who had become accustomed to having
their postage fixed by the application of the rate of one penny
for each half ounce, could not in many cases be made to understand
why the same principle did not apply to their letters to
their friends and relatives beyond the seas.</p>

<p>Hence many letters weighing less than half an ounce were
sent to Canada, which on examination were found to contain
enclosures, and the postage was, in accordance with the regulations,
doubled or even trebled, though their weight would not
call for a charge of more than one shilling and twopence.</p>

<p>Poulett Thomson drew attention to the obvious embarrassment
occasioned by the application of the two different principles, and
he had the satisfaction of finding a ready acquiescence in his views
on the part of the postal authorities at home. Accordingly, by the
treasury minute of July 6th, 1840, the rate on letters conveyed by
direct packet from any post office in the United Kingdom to Halifax
was made one shilling the half ounce. If, for any other post office,
the rate was one shilling and twopence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Diminution of powers of deputy postmaster general&mdash;Commission on post
office appointed&mdash;Its report&mdash;Efforts to secure reduction of postal charges.</p></div>


<p>The arrival of Poulett Thomson as governor general marks the
passing of the uncontrolled authority of Stayner as administrator
of the post office in the Canadas. By the terms of their commissions,
the deputies of the postmaster general in the colonies,
were responsible to the postmaster general alone for the conduct
of the affairs of the post offices within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Subject to the approval of the postmaster general, the deputies
opened all post offices, appointed all postmasters and other officers
of the department, and made all contracts for the conveyance of
the mails. Until Stayner's time, the department at home exercised
a watchful oversight in one particular. It insisted that the deputy
postmaster general should not extend the system, or increase the
accommodation within it, unless he could satisfy St. Martins-le-Grand
that the additional outlay required should be met by a
corresponding increase in the revenue. Assured on this point,
the department gave the deputies a practically free hand.</p>

<p>Insistence on the point of finances brought the general post
office into sharp collision with the colonial legislatures for a number
of years. But shortly after Stayner's assumption of office, the
department in London loosened the reins, and directed him to
study the wants of the rising communities, and extend postal
accommodation to whatever districts seemed to him to require it.</p>

<p>The confidence bestowed by the postmaster general on his
young deputy in the Canadas was not misplaced. Stayner was a
man of energy and authority, who had grown up in the service
under the administration of his father-in-law, who was his predecessor
in office, and his loyalty to the interests of both the postmaster
general and the community he served stood unquestioned.
With his appointment to his high office, he fell heir to a dispute
which had been waged for a number of years between the general
post office and the legislatures of Upper and Lower Canada, involving
the legal right of the post office to do business in the
colonies under existing conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Stayner was fortunate in finding in each province differences
between the administration and the houses of assembly, which
gave little promise of settlement, and he promptly attached himself
to the side of the administration. This, indeed, was the only course
open to him, in view of his accountability to a department, which,
in according him a certain freedom of action, took jealous heed
that he should not abuse it.</p>

<p>But Stayner had important interests of his own, which called
for protection by the government. His extra-official emoluments&mdash;from
the postage on newspapers, and from his agency for the
collection of United States postage, due in Canada&mdash;now far
exceeding his official salary, began to excite public attention,
and he required all the support he could gather to himself, to
enable him to brave it out with the assemblies, when they insisted
on his showing by what right he took these emoluments.</p>

<p>His position, however repugnant to popular notions, was
officially unassailable, and as he managed to identify his interests
with those of the administrations, the governors of the two provinces
remained steadily his friends and protectors. He had even the
gratification of being commended for his great services by the
assembly of Upper Canada in 1837.</p>

<p>But a change was coming for Stayner, and indeed had come.
Ever since the amount and the sources of his income became known
to the home government, there had been disapprobation. The
secretary of the post office, a large part of whose income had been
derived from similar extra-official sources, deprecated the criticism
which began to spring up, and the postmaster general weakly and
reluctantly agreed that Stayner's exceptional services entitled
him to exceptional emoluments.</p>

<p>The colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg, however, was of another
mind. The two provinces were seething with dissatisfaction, and
it was not clear to him in what the grievances of the colonials
consisted. A committee of the house of commons had sat in 1828,
heard evidence, and reported, and the leaders of the assembly
in Lower Canada had declared that if the recommendations of
the committee were carried into effect, the province would be
content.</p>

<p>Guiding his policy by that report, and seeking every opportunity
to make good its findings, the colonial secretary observed that the
political dissatisfaction and unrest, so far from disappearing, was
spreading year by year. His bewilderment sharpened his eyes, and
as they rested on Stayner's case, he saw a condition which offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
his sense of justice, and he at once demanded of the postmaster
general that he should remove this obvious wrong.</p>

<p>For a time Stayner's tactics, or his luck, held him scatheless.
The postmaster general and the colonial secretary had agreed
that the remedy for all the ills that afflicted the post office was to
be provided by the bill adopted by the imperial parliament in 1834.
This bill, however, could not become operative until the acceptance
by the several colonial legislatures of a common measure for the
regulation of the post office in the several provinces by the postmaster
general of England. As all the colonies had rejected this
measure, the situation remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Stayner continued to take his exorbitant emoluments, and the
government was helpless. The postmaster general asked the
colonial secretary to furnish him with an expedient for settling
the matter, but the colonial secretary could think of nothing, to
which overriding legal or political objections could not be made.
While, however, Stayner enjoyed immunity from attacks by the
government, he was a marked man, and when Poulett Thomson
came to Canada, he lost no time in making Stayner realize that the
period of his exceptional fortunes was at an end.</p>

<p>Poulett Thomson's special mission to Canada was to lay the
foundations of responsible government in the country, and he
began by taking things into his own hands. In dealing with the
post office he sent for Stayner, and, instead of treating him as an
officer of independent authority, Thomson informed Stayner that
it was his intention to reform the post office in its construction
and duties.</p>

<p>All the governor general required of Stayner was that the
latter should furnish him with any information he considered
necessary. Although Thomson had never had any actual experience
in the workings of a post office he had opportunities of acquiring
a sound theoretical knowledge on the subject. He was
a member of the committee of the house of commons which was
appointed in 1837 to examine the proposition of Rowland Hill
for penny postage.</p>

<p>As Hill's scheme involved an entire change in post office
methods, the <i>modus operandi</i> at that time pursued was thoroughly
set out to the committee, its weaknesses exposed, and the merits of
the new proposition fully discussed. No observant man could
attend the work of that committee without gaining definite views
as to the principles upon which a post office should be conducted.</p>

<p>In June 1840, Stayner reported to the secretary of the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
post office a state of affairs that indicated that Thomson had
taken the direction of post office affairs into his own hands. He
had ordered Stayner to enter into negotiations for the conveyance
of mails by steamer between Quebec and Montreal, and upon lake
Ontario, and when the negotiations failed, he expressed a determination
to obtain authority to build vessels for post office
purposes. He also directed Stayner to draw up a bill for the
administration of the post office in British North America upon
principles to be determined by the governor.</p>

<p>The colonial secretary, in July, instructed the governor to
appoint a commission to investigate and report upon the post
office in the colonies in all its bearings. The committee as
appointed consisted of Dowling, legal adviser to the governor,
Davidson, senior commissioner of crown lands, and Stayner.</p>

<p>In point of ability the committee was a competent one. Its
members all had that sort of experience in public affairs, which
would enable them to apprize fairly the mass of information laid
before them&mdash;evidence which would satisfy the public as to the
justice of their conclusions.</p>

<p>But having in mind the aims of the committee, its composition
was not such as to give hope for harmonious co-operation among
its members. The colonial secretary in instructing the governor
general to appoint the committee, directed that it should investigate
and report on the state of the British North American post office,
including its administration.</p>

<p>The work of the committee was necessarily a scrutiny into the
methods of the administration of Stayner, and involved an attitude
of defence on his part. And the other members of the committee
did not fail to make him feel the difficulty of his dual position.
Although he signed the report as a commissioner, he appended a
note to it stating that he did so, merely because he conceived it
to be his duty as a commissioner.</p>

<p>But he also intimated that he was far from agreeing with all
the conclusions of his associates; and a few months later he
presented a statement to the governor general, pointing out the
respects in which he differed from the other commissioners, and
defending himself against charges which were set forth in the report.</p>

<p>The committee entered upon their work by calling upon the
deputy postmasters general of Canada and the Maritime provinces
for a body of statistics and other matter, which, when furnished,
provided them with a survey of the whole colonial system, and its
methods of operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Detailed information was given in tabular form of every post
office in the colonies&mdash;the name and date of appointment of its
postmaster, the revenue of the office, and the several items that
composed the postmaster's income; and of every mail route,
with its cost of maintenance. All regulations for the guidance
of postmasters in the management of their offices were submitted
to the commission.</p>

<p>The commissioners addressed circular letters to all the postmasters,
and to prominent people in every section of the colonies,
inviting them to give their views on the post offices in their
locality, and asking particularly as to the extent letters were
carried by agencies other than the post office, and their opinions
as to why these other agencies were employed in preference to the
post office.</p>

<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inofrmation'">information</ins> obtained was most voluminous, and the report
of the commission based upon it was comprehensive.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It began
with a historical sketch of the post office in the colonies, from its
origin down to the time of the commission; passed on to a survey
of the institution as it then stood; pointed out the defects they
discovered in its arrangements; and concluded by a number of
recommendations for the removal of the defects, and the improvement
of the system.</p>

<p>The defects which most impressed the commissioners were
the want of uniformity within the system, and the uncontrolled
power of the representatives of the postmaster general in the
colonies. As illustrating the lack of uniformity, they pointed out
that though the colonies were in postal theory an undivided whole,
they were under the control of two deputies of the postmaster
general, who were entirely independent of one another, and that
no effort seemed to have been made to co-ordinate the practice
in the two jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The absence of organization was more noticeable in the Maritime
provinces, a condition which the commissioners attributed to the
failure of the deputy at Halifax to establish general regulations,
and to the want of travelling surveyors or inspectors, who might
have introduced uniformity of practice among the postmasters.</p>

<p>A striking instance of unauthorized variation from usual post
office practice was the existence of way offices. These were, to
all intents and purposes, post offices, and yet they had no official
recognition as such.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>These way offices were set up at any convenient place along the
line of the post roads. They were put in operation, sometimes
by local magistrates, or other people of importance in the districts;
sometimes by neighbouring postmasters, and sometimes by the
deputy postmaster general. They had no accounting relations
with the head of the department, but carried on their work under
the control of an adjacent postmaster who was held responsible
for the postage collected by them.</p>

<p>In spite of their anomalous character, these way offices had a
usefulness of their own; for they were not abolished until after
the Nova Scotia post office was absorbed in the post office department
of the dominion in 1867.</p>

<p>The commission in support of their second conclusion, that the
power of the deputies of the postmaster general were subject to
no practical control, and that the abuses usually associated with
irresponsibility were not absent from the administration of the
colonial post office, submitted two cases which had come under
their notice, and which seemed to show that in these cases at least
Stayner was chargeable with maladministration and nepotism.</p>

<p>Stayner in his rejoinder defended himself with vigour and
success against the imputations of his colleagues, and retorted
upon Dowling, the chairman, with charges of unfairness and
studied discourtesy towards himself. The bearing of Dowling
was so offensive that Stayner was with difficulty restrained from
severing his relations with the commission.</p>

<p>The remedies proposed by the commission for the two cardinal
defects to which they had drawn attention, were simple and
efficacious. They would place the whole colonial postal system
in the hands of a single deputy postmaster general, who should
own responsibility, not only to his official superior in England,
but also, in all points which did not conflict with his primary duty,
to the executive heads of the several provinces, so far as related
to the parts of the system within their respective jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the deputy postmaster general, the commission
urged, should be at the capital of the province of Canada,
and he should be under the orders of the governor general. The
authority of the deputy postmaster general in the other provinces
should be vested in local inspectors, whose relations with the lieutenant
governors were to be identical with those which should
subsist between the deputy postmaster general and the governor
general.</p>

<p>In cases occurring in the other provinces, which appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
transcend the powers of the local inspectors, the lieutenant governors
might correspond with the governor general, and the inspectors
with the deputy. Stayner objected to the plan proposed, in so
far as it took the appointments to postmasterships and other
offices out of the hands of the representative of the postmaster
general, and made them the subject of political patronage.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the questions relating to the organization
and administration of the department, the commissioners proceeded
to discuss matters bearing upon its operations.</p>

<p>The first of these was the rates of postage. In dealing with
this subject the commission had before them a mass of evidence
from all parts of the colonies, which convinced them that the great
bulk of the letters exchanged, did not pass through the post office.
It was asserted by responsible persons that, in some parts of the
country, scarcely ten per cent. of the letters written were conveyed
by the post office, and in few cases was the estimate of letters
carried by private means less than fifty per cent.</p>

<p>Though various other reasons were given for this systematic
evasion of the only lawful means of conveying letters&mdash;the infrequency
of the couriers' services, and the public distrust in the
security of the mails&mdash;there was practical unanimity in the declaration
that the chief obstacle in the way of the public's using the post
office was the excessive rates of postage.</p>

<p>The commission found that there was a strong sentiment among
their correspondents, favouring the adoption of the system then
recently introduced into England by the genius of Rowland Hill.
Until 1840, the postal rates in England were substantially the
same as those which hampered the post office in the colonies;
and the general avoidance of the post office by the merchants and
other writers of letters in that country was as marked as it was in
Canada.</p>

<p>Richard Cobden declared that not one-sixth of the letters
exchanged in England were transmitted through the post office,
and other observers of equal authority bore similar emphatic
testimony. The displacement of the complicated system of charges
based on the number of enclosures and the distance the letters
were carried, and the adoption of a penny rate carrying letters to
all parts of the United Kingdom, immediately turned all the
streams of correspondence into the channels of the post office.
Not only were the private letter-carrying agencies put out of business,
but the low, easily comprehended rate called into existence
a vast body of new correspondence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Few people in Canada believed in the possibility of a rate as
low as a penny for the Canadian post office, but many were attracted
by the fascination of a uniform charge even though it should be
higher than that, which was so vastly augmenting correspondence
in England.</p>

<p>To all such, whether the uniform rate they advocated were a
penny or higher, the commission addressed themselves, pointing
out that the geographical, social and industrial differences between
England and the colonies, made it impracticable to base an argument
for the one upon the experience of the other.</p>

<p>Uniform penny postage was an immediate success in the United
Kingdom because in the United Kingdom there were three thickly-populated
countries, with highly developed social and industrial
systems. Hill discovered, by a study of the postal statistics laid
before the house of commons, that in consequence of the great
volume of correspondence exchanged, the comparatively short
distances letters were as a rule carried, and the highly developed
system of transportation, the average cost of carrying a letter in
the United Kingdom did not exceed one farthing. A sum equally
small covered the expenses of administration and the maintenance
of post offices.</p>

<p>A further discovery of equal importance, which surprised Hill
as much as it did anybody, was that the difference in expense
between carrying a letter the shortest and the longest possible
distances in the kingdom was so small that it could not be expressed
in the least valuable coin in use.</p>

<p>In these facts lay the whole case for uniform penny postage.
At a penny a letter, there was a clear profit to the post office, and
the augmentation in the number of letters as a result of this
inducement to correspondence made almost any imaginable profits
possible; and the insignificant difference in cost between carrying
letters long and short distances, led inevitably to the ideal
uniform rate.</p>

<p>The conditions in the British North American colonies were in
all respects the reverse of those existing in England. The vast
extent of their territories, the sparseness of their populations, and
their undeveloped state, socially and industrially, all combined to
make the postal system very costly, and the returns meagre; and
the great, almost unsettled, stretches between the centres of population
made the difference in the cost of conveyance between long
and short distances very considerable.</p>

<p>The commission, with such statistics as were available before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
them, estimated that the average expense of delivering a letter
was threepence for conveyance, and twopence-halfpenny for
overhead and maintenance charges. These figures showed the
impracticability of either low or uniform postage rates, unless the
legislatures were willing to take on themselves the yearly deficits,
which were certain to occur.</p>

<p>The commission, however, were prepared to recommend considerable
reductions in the charges, even though these should result
in a noticeable shrinkage in the revenue. Indeed, it seemed
to them a distinct advantage that the revenue should be brought
down to a point, at which it would no more than meet the expenses.
They took it as settled that the British government would adhere
to the principle of the imperial bill of 1834, under which the surplus
revenues were to be divided among the colonies; and they foresaw
serious difficulties among the provinces in dealing with the problem
of distributing the surplus.</p>

<p>The rates they recommended&mdash;ranging from twopence a letter
when the conveyance did not exceed thirty miles up to one shilling
for a distance over three hundred miles&mdash;were much lower than
those charged at that time by the post office.</p>

<p>Dealing with the question of newspaper postage, the commission
condemned the impropriety of allowing the sums accruing under
this head to pass into the pockets of the deputies of the postmaster
general, and recommended that newspapers should be charged at
the rate of one-halfpenny each, and that the proceeds should go
with the other postage into the treasury.</p>

<p>A point, interesting as illustrating one of the differences of view
between ourselves and our grandfathers, was that the commissioners
strongly recommended that the prepayment of postage on newspapers
should not continue to be compulsory, but that it should be
optional whether the sum should be paid by the sender or recipient
of the newspaper.</p>

<p>It had never been held that the sender of a letter should pay
the postage; and to the public it appeared a hardship that there
should be a different practice as regards newspapers. Indeed
the committee saw very good reasons from the standpoint of the
post office why the payment of postage on newspapers should be
deferred. If postmasters could add to their revenues, and consequently
to their salaries, by collecting the postage when delivering
newspapers, they would have a strong motive for seeing that the
papers were delivered.</p>

<p>The commission closed their report by noting a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
details of post office practice: the demand for more post offices
throughout the provinces, which they endorsed; complaints of
the inconvenience of sites of post offices; the hours post offices
should be open to the public, and the time for closing the mails;
special handling of money letters, and the enforcement of the
terms of mail contracts, and the salaries of postmasters. On all
these matters they commented at length, and made a number of
helpful suggestions.</p>

<p>The report was presented to the governor general on December
31, 1841. While it was in course of preparation&mdash;on November 29,
1841&mdash;the post office building in Quebec was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>For Stayner this was a serious misfortune. Not only was he
compelled to withdraw his attention from the affairs of the commission,
in order to make provision for carrying on the departmental
work, but he was crippled in drawing up his rejoinder by the fact
that all his papers were consumed with the building, and material
upon which he had depended for explanation and justification of
transactions called in question was no longer available. His
statement was not laid before the governor general until the April
following.</p>

<p>In it, besides confuting the conclusions of the other commissioners
on the matters affecting his administration of the post office, Stayner
discussed a number of questions, in which he differed in opinion
from his colleagues. He expressed a qualified approval of the scale
of postage rates recommended in the report, and agreed entirely
with them in their proposals respecting the postage on newspapers.</p>

<p>But Stayner was convinced that his colleagues took entirely too
favourable a view as to the effect of the postage reductions on the
revenue of the department, and he strongly recommended that,
before the proposed changes should be approved, the whole scheme
should be submitted to the provincial legislatures, with its probable
financial consequences, in order that an assurance might be obtained
from them that the deficits which he foresaw should be made good
by the provinces.</p>

<p>The first of the measures taken by the government on the
report of the commissioners was to deprive Stayner of a portion
of his power. The proposal to place him under the direction of the
governor general was not entertained in its entirety. But in
August 1842, the appointment of his postmasters was taken out of
his hands, and transferred to the governor general.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>Stayner protested that it would be out of his power satisfactorily
to discharge his responsibility as resident head of the post office
if he were deprived of the selection of his officials. The postmaster
general may have agreed with Stayner, but the decision of the
matter was not allowed to rest with him. Consequently, he had
no choice, but to inform Stayner that the question was closed, and
that he would have to conform to the new conditions.</p>

<p>So much freedom of action, however, was still left with Stayner
that he was not expected to retain the services of any official
who failed to satisfy his requirements. But he could no longer
dismiss peremptorily. The official under condemnation was to be
afforded an opportunity for defence before his case was finally
disposed of. Thereafter, and until the post office was transferred
to the control of the Canadian government, whenever a vacancy
occurred among the postmasters, the nomination was made by the
governor, and the official appointment of the person selected,
was made by the postmaster general.</p>

<p>In August 1843, Lord Stanley, the colonial secretary, notified
the governor that on assuming office, he found awaiting him the
report of the commission, but owing to the complexity of the
matters involved, and to the fact that further representations on
the same subject had been received from the colonies, the government
was unable to arrive at a conclusion until that time.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The decisions arrived at by the government and imparted to
the governor were of far-reaching importance. The practice
which had prevailed ever since the post office was established, of
fixing the postage on letters, according to the number of enclosures
they contained was to be abolished, and the weight system to be
introduced to replace it. A single letter thereafter was to be one
which weighed less than half an ounce, and the postage determined
by the number of half ounces it weighed. The rates themselves
were not changed, nor was the principle of regarding the distance
a letter was carried any factor in the postage, in any way affected.</p>

<p>But though the effect of the substitution of the weight system
for that based on enclosures was not great, so far as concerned the
amount of postage required on a letter, much was gained in the
direction of simplicity and propriety, when there was no longer the
constant appeal to the postmaster's curiosity, and, at times, cupidity,
which was made by the regulation requiring him to hold up
every letter between him and a lighted candle, in order to satisfy
himself as to the number of its contents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Another reform, no less welcome to the public, was the abolition
of the privilege conceded to the deputy postmaster general of
putting into his own pocket the proceeds of the postage on newspapers.
The recommendation of the commission that newspapers
should be charged one-halfpenny each, the proceeds to form part
of the post office revenue, was adopted by the government.</p>

<p>These changes went into operation on the 5th of January, 1844.
By way of compensation to the deputy postmaster general for
the loss of his newspaper and other perquisites, he was given the not
unhandsome salary of £2500 sterling a year. This was an amount
much beyond what the treasury considered should be paid as
salary for this office, in the absence of the special circumstances of
Stayner's case, and the salary of his successor was fixed at £1500
a year.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>The merchants and other large users of the post office, while
perhaps not unmindful of what had been gained, still had little
cause for satisfaction with the results of the labours of the commission.
Substantial reductions in the postage were still unattained.
The movement in the colonies was greatly stimulated
by the course of events in England as regards penny postage.</p>

<p>Post office officials had, from various motives, decried the
great reform, and ministers of the crown, with their eyes on the
diminished revenue, doubted whether the public benefits had been
commensurate with the cost. Opposition to the continuance of
the experiment had reached a point when it became a question
whether modifications in the direction of higher charges should not
be made.</p>

<p>In 1844 the government appointed a committee of the house
of commons to inquire as to the measure of public benefit that could
fairly be attributed to penny postage. The committee made no
report, but they submitted a mass of evidence taken from every
quarter of the kingdom, and from every walk in life, that effectually
silenced objectors, and aroused a desire in all civilized countries
for the enjoyment of a similar boon, to the extent that their
circumstances would permit. The United States, in 1846, after a
period of agitation, reduced its charges to five cents a letter,
where the conveyance did not exceed a distance of three thousand
miles, doubling the charge for greater distances.</p>

<p>The British North American colonies shared to the full in the
general desire for the abatement of the impediments to the freer
circulation of correspondence. The Canadian legislature, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
1845, was called upon to deal with a number of memorials on
this subject, and asked Stayner for his advice.</p>

<p>Stayner was prepared to welcome any reductions that the
legislature might be able to obtain, but he warned them that
whatever might be the ultimate effect of lowered postage rates
on the augmentation of correspondence, there would be an intermediate
period, in which the shrinkage of revenue would be considerable,
and it was for the legislature to determine whether the
general financial condition of the province would warrant their
incurring even a temporary deficit in the post office.</p>

<p>The legislature having in view the fact that the surplus revenue
of the post office was only £8000 at the time, decided that it would
be unwise to embark on any undertaking that threatened them with
additional financial burdens.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> But the public in Canada were of a
different opinion. The boards of trade of Montreal, Toronto and
Quebec petitioned the postmaster general for a rate of twopence-halfpenny
a letter, and, in 1846, the legislature casting caution
aside presented a strong address to the queen. In it they pointed
out the hardship endured by British subjects in one portion of the
empire, in being compelled to pay extravagant charges for that
which is enjoyed by others at merely nominal cost; and begged to
be put on an equal footing in this regard with the citizens of the
United States.</p>

<p>The legislatures of the Maritime provinces were pressing on
the home government demands of a similar character with equal
vigour, and as the policy adopted by the home government was the
result of the combined pressure, and affected all the colonies
identically, it is desirable, before dealing with that policy, to bring
the narrative of events in the Maritime provinces forward to this
point.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Continuation of account of post office in Maritime provinces&mdash;Departmental
inquiry into conditions&mdash;Agitation for reduced postage.</p></div>


<p>The information elicited from Howe by the general post office
in London, and the house of assembly of Nova Scotia, in the course
of the inquiry as to the financial position of the post office in that
province, disclosed matter for considerable surprise to both of them.</p>

<p>The general post office learned for the first time that for some
years the provincial post office was carried on partly with the
assistance of the legislature. The assembly on its side was equally
unaware of the fact that, while they were making annual grants
in aid of the provincial establishment, a very considerable sum
was being remitted each year by the deputy postmaster general
to the British treasury as surplus postal revenue.</p>

<p>This anomalous state of affairs was corrected, and a more
satisfactory footing was established as the result of the mission of
the Nova Scotia delegates to England in 1839. But one is inclined
to wonder how this condition of ignorance could continue with
Howe, a perfectly honest man, in constant communication with
his official superiors in England on the one hand, and with the
legislature on the other.</p>

<p>It would seem to have arisen from the fact that the post office
in Nova Scotia was a much more intimate institution than the
post office was in Canada. Circumstances, as has been seen,
maintained a gulf between the post office in Canada and the
provincial legislatures. The antagonism of the legislatures in
the two Canadas towards the post office, arising from their belief
in the illegality of its foundation, and the steady struggle on their
part to bring the institution within the sphere of their authority,
operated to prevent the establishment of intimate relations between
the legislatures and the deputy postmasters general.</p>

<p>All these separative factors were absent in Nova Scotia. The
Howes, father and son, had administered the post office for nearly
forty years. They were constantly occupied with the public life
of the province. They published the principal newspapers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Joseph Howe, son of the one, and brother of the other, was one
of the leaders in the legislature. The younger Howe was also
a commissioner for the summary trial of actions, and for the poor,
both of which appointments he held without salary.</p>

<p>The interests of the Howes were as much engaged to the affairs
of the province, as to those of the general post office, and this fact
was recognized by the legislature. When, therefore, there was a
question of extending the postal lines into new districts, Howe
was fully sympathetic, and it was felt, by the assembly, when he
informed them that they must be prepared to make up any
deficiencies in the cost of the new services, that he spoke as one of
themselves, but with authority, and there was no more question.</p>

<p>As a consequence, new routes sprang up gradually in different
parts of the province, under the simple arrangement that the
postage collected on the route would be applied as far as it would
go to meet the expenses of the postmasters and mail couriers,
and that the legislature would make up what was lacking.</p>

<p>Thus, on the western line, from Halifax to Yarmouth, and
around the shore to Lunenburg, the revenue collected was in 1839
only £378, whereas the expenditure was rather more than £900
beyond this sum. On the eastern line, the shortage to be made
up by the legislature was over £450. The northern line, that is,
through Londonderry, Amherst, Wallace, Dorchester and Parrsboro
nearly paid its expenses. The province had to contribute no more
than £60, to cover the deficiency.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>All that the general post office had been informed regarding
these routes was that the revenues from them were being held to
pay expenses. They had no idea that there were heavy deficiencies,
which the legislatures provided for by annual votes, arranged
between Howe and the post office committee of the legislative
assembly. Howe held, when brought to account for his remissness,
that as these routes were under the authority of the province, and
not of the postmaster general, there was no object in embodying
them in his accounts.</p>

<p>The general post office did not know of the existence of the post
offices of Yarmouth, Shelburne, Liverpool and Lunenburg on the
west and south coasts; Antigonishe, Wallace and Parrsboro on
the north; and Arichat and Sydney in Cape Breton, all of which
had been in operation for a number of years.</p>

<p>The only route in the province that yielded a revenue sufficient
to meet expenses was the grand route leading to Canada, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
branch to Pictou. As the grand route was employed for the conveyance
through the provinces of the valuable mails exchanged
between Canada and Great Britain, it was naturally very
remunerative.</p>

<p>The agreement with the treasury, satisfactory as it was in
appearance, had in it the seeds of misunderstanding. The treasury
announced its willingness that, so long as the revenue from the
internal post office was sufficient to meet the expense of the
internal communications, no demand for this object should be made
upon the provincial funds. The terms of the minute seem to lack
nothing in clearness, unless some of the words employed were held
to have a significance other than that usually accepted. That
is what was the case in this minute.</p>

<p>The treasury, in selecting the words it used, meant nothing more
or less than that, if the revenue collected on letters passing within
the territories of Nova Scotia were sufficient to cover the expense
of maintaining the post offices and mail couriers within the province,
the provincial authorities would be exempt from all liability.</p>

<p>The legislature accepted this view of the case on all but one
point. They maintained that Halifax post office existed mainly
for imperial purposes,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> in that its chief function was to provide
for the interchange of the mails between Canada and Great
Britain, and that its value as a provincial institution was fully
offset by the advantages extended by Nova Scotia to Great Britain
and Canada in providing for the transmission of their mails across
its territory.</p>

<p>Holding this view, the assembly examined the accounts laid
before them by Howe, and satisfied themselves that, omitting
the expenses of Halifax post office from consideration, the internal
postage practically covered the expenses of the internal service.
They therefore resolved that no vote would be required during
that session. They pledged themselves, however, in case the
revenue of that year should prove inadequate, to provide for the
deficiency, so that the services should not be interrupted or
diminished.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1840, there was an unquestionable
surplus of revenue over expenditure; consequently no demand
was made upon the legislature. In 1841, the friction, which was
certain to develop when Howe's loose methods were subjected to
any strain, began to make itself felt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>In April of that year, Howe advised the lieutenant governor,
Lord Falkland, that the funds available for the payment of the
post office expenditure were deficient to the extent of £546.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> He,
at the same time, submitted to the lieutenant governor his correspondence
with the general post office in London, from which it
appeared that the general post office, fearing that the omission of
the legislature to make any provision for the service would lead to
a deficiency, intimated that it might be necessary to make some
curtailments, and asked whether some of the less productive routes
might not be discontinued.</p>

<p>Howe, following his usual practice, had consulted with
several members of the legislature, and being satisfied that the
legislature would make up any shortage that arose, concluded
that there would be no necessity of abandoning any of the
lines.</p>

<p>It was only when the legislature was prorogued without making
provision for a possible shortage, that Howe submitted the question
to the governor. Falkland was rather embarrassed by the responsibility
thus unnecessarily thrust upon him. But as he was
of opinion that it would cause much inconvenience to stop any of
the mail routes, he directed the amount of the shortage to be paid.
The lieutenant governor, however, in relating the circumstances
to the colonial secretary, took occasion to complain of Howe's
methods.</p>

<p>The communications respecting the post office passed him by
entirely, unless some trouble arose which made an appeal necessary.
In the present case, if he had been made acquainted with the
circumstances in time, he would have laid them before the legislature,
and left them to decide whether any of the services were
to be dropped, or the deficit made up. As a result, Howe was
admonished that his irregular practice must cease, and that when
recourse to the legislature was necessary, he should approach
them through the lieutenant governor alone.</p>

<p>In 1842, the situation became more acute. The assembly had
before them the accounts of 1841, in which figured the additional
expenses due to the ambitious transatlantic steamship scheme.
At the best, the revenues from the inland services were no more
than sufficient to meet its expenses, and the increase in the cost
of the conveyance between Halifax and Pictou from £285 a year
to £1937 (£1550 sterling), and the additional expense in the Halifax
post office from £625 a year to £1694 due to a large augmentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
in the staff, involved the legislature in a situation, to which they
were disinclined to submit.</p>

<p>The trouble was precipitated by a letter from Howe to the
lieutenant governor, informing him that, as the sum of £1143 had
been advanced by him from the packet postage, which belonged
to the British treasury, and as the legislature had appropriated
only £550 to meet this advance, there was still the sum of £593 due
to His Majesty.</p>

<p>The assembly to whom Howe's communication was referred, took
the opportunity of reviewing the whole situation. It was beyond
doubt that, in 1839, the internal postal service was self-supporting.
This condition was disturbed to the detriment of the financial
position of the post office by burdening it with the total expense
of the Pictou service, which was maintained principally for the
benefit of New Brunswick and Canada, and of the Halifax post
office, which since the establishment of the ocean steam service
for all the colonies was in reality much more an imperial than a
provincial institution.</p>

<p>As, in justice, the inland colonies were chargeable with the major
part of the outlay for the Pictou service, and the maintenance of
Halifax post office should properly be defrayed from the packet
postage, the legislature declined to meet the demand made upon
it by the post office.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor was in full sympathy with the legislature,
and after fortifying himself with the opinions of his law
officers as to the legal aspects of the case, appealed to the governor
general to induce the Canadian government to take on themselves
the proper share of the charge.</p>

<p>The Canadian government for the reasons given could not see
the propriety of their taking on themselves any part of the expense
of conveying mails to their outport at Quebec, and the British
government were powerless to bring pressure on the Canadians,
since the treasury was in receipt annually of large remittances
from Stayner as surplus post office revenues, which the British
government, by their act of 1834, admitted to belong to the colonies,
and which only awaited colonial legislation to be handed over to
the several legislatures.</p>

<p>The treasury was willing also as a measure of grace to allow
the colonial legislatures to retain the part of the packet postage
collected in the colonies, if they would only adopt the scheme
involved in the act of 1834. But it was not prepared to admit
that any part of the packet was, as a matter of right, chargeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
with the maintenance of the post office at Halifax or of the Pictou
coach service, and as it was becoming plain that the scheme of
making Halifax the distributing centre for the Canadas, was not
proving the success they hoped for, they determined to inquire
as to the feasibility of having a port in the United States utilized
in the exchange between Canada and Great Britain.</p>

<p>To that end, an official of the British post office, W. J. Page,
was sent to Nova Scotia to investigate this subject, and at the same
time to make a thorough inquiry into the condition of the Nova
Scotia post office, which had been animadverted upon rather
severely by the royal commission, in its report of 1841.</p>

<p>By means of Page's reports and of the report of this commission,
we are enabled to give a clear account of the Nova Scotia post office
in the beginning of the forties. There were eighteen post offices
in the province at this period, and fifty-one sub-offices. The
mails were carried on the route from Halifax to Pictou and St.
John three times a week in summer and twice a week in winter.</p>

<p>From Pictou the mails were carried to Antigonishe twice a week,
and with the same frequency from Halifax to Annapolis. Mails
were carried in all directions throughout the province, but, with the
exceptions mentioned, only once a week.</p>

<p>The management of this considerable system was in the hands
of the deputy postmaster general and his assistant. It was impossible
with the work demanding their attention in Halifax, and
the deficiency of facilities for travel, that these two could give any
attention to the offices which were not under their immediate eye,
and consequently all attempts to exercise control over the operation
of the system came by degrees to be abandoned. When postmasters
were appointed, all the instructions they received were a
few short directions from the deputy postmaster general, or from
an outgoing predecessor, whose knowledge was a combination
made up of the official instructions and the interpretations placed
upon them, when occasion arose that required some action or
decision on his part.</p>

<p>The way offices&mdash;those peculiar products of the Maritime provinces&mdash;excited
the ridicule of English and Canadian trained
officials. Page, in a letter to the secretary of the general post office,
expressed his despair of comprehending the varieties of origin
or practice of these offices. Not one in ten of the keepers of these
offices were appointed by Howe; nor did he or any one in his
office know the names of many of them, though Howe considered
the offices to have been sanctioned by him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>What happened was like this: a postmaster would write to
Howe telling him that there ought to be a house for leaving letters
at, in such or such a village or settlement. If any person were
mentioned as willing to take charge of the letters, Howe generally
agreed to his being appointed, and considered the matter settled.
If no particular person was mentioned, Howe agreed to the suggestion
that there should be a receiving house in the place indicated,
and left the selection to the postmaster.</p>

<p>The whole affair was considered as a private matter between
postmaster and way office keeper; no letter bills or forms of any
description were ever supplied to the way office keepers, and so
long as they paid to the postmasters the amount of postage due
on letters sent to them for delivery, the very existence of these
offices was ignored.</p>

<p>These way offices were known locally as twopenny offices, that
is, the keepers charged twopence on every letter passing through
their hands. An instance will explain the mode of operation in
these offices. A gentleman living in Port Hood, on the west coast
of Cape Breton, stated that he had sent a double letter weighing
less than half an ounce a distance of fifty miles; and as it had to
pass through five way offices, the charge was one shilling and
eightpence (thirty-three cents). He received letters from England,
which cost one shilling and fourpence (twenty-seven cents) from
England to the Straits of Canso; but the conveyance from that
point to his home, a distance of twenty-six miles, cost one shilling
and fourpence more.</p>

<p>The anomalies were due partly to the mixed character of the
control of the system in the province, and partly to the inability
of the deputy postmaster general, owing to his lack of efficient
help, to supervise the system. Howe was under the authority
both of the postmaster general in England, and of the provincial
government, which provided for the maintenance of a number of
offices, which would not have been sanctioned by the postmaster
general on account of the expense.</p>

<p>Illegal conveyance of letters was the rule in this province, as
well as in all the others. The great proportion of the correspondence
between the towns and villages on the long coast was carried
by trading vessels. On some of the main routes, notably from Halifax
to Pictou and to Annapolis, there were fast four-horse coaches.
They travelled eight miles an hour in summer and five in winter. They
were employed to carry the mails, but it never happened that the
mail bags contained as many letters as the pockets of the passengers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>In Cape Breton there was not a single carriage road in the island.
Most of the roads were mere bridle paths, and in many parts there
were no roads of any kind. It took five days to carry the mail bag
from Halifax to Sydney during the summer, and from eleven to
eighteen in the winter.</p>

<p>The deputy postmaster general had a salary of £400 a year,
which was supplemented by the amounts collected as newspaper
postage. In 1841, the amount of this perquisite was £330 a year.
It was a cause of complaint on the part of rival publishers that
the <i>Nova Scotian</i>, the leading newspaper in the province, paid
no postage. As the circulation of this paper&mdash;1400 copies a week&mdash;was
more than double that of any other paper in the province,
the grievance was a real one.</p>

<p>In explanation of the exemption, Howe stated that for ten years
before he purchased the <i>Nova Scotian</i>, the proprietor, Joseph
Howe, had assisted him in the management of the office for eleven
months while the deputy postmaster general was in England,
taking full management of the provincial system. For these
services Joseph Howe had asked no compensation, and the deputy
postmaster general had therefore taken no remuneration for
mailing the newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>There were only two towns in the province where letters were
delivered by carriers&mdash;Halifax and Yarmouth. In Halifax, the
city was divided between two carriers, whose pay consisted of the
fees they were entitled to take from the recipients of the letters
they delivered, at a penny a letter. They attempted to charge the
same sum for the delivery of each newspaper, but many persons
would not pay the fee. The carriers received £2 10<i>s.</i> and £2 a
week respectively. Yarmouth also had two carriers, whose penny
fees gave them each about £12 10<i>s.</i> a year.</p>

<p>The relations between the deputy postmaster general and the
provincial government were the subject of much critical comment
on the part of Page. The fact that the government contributed
to the maintenance of the less remunerative routes and post
offices gave the executive and the assembly a colour of title to
interfere in the management of the post office, which was exercised,
in Page's opinion, beyond all due bounds.</p>

<p>The governor's secretary was in the habit of giving Howe
orders, and if Howe showed any hesitation in complying with them,
he became offensively peremptory. Investigations into complaints
against postmasters were taken into the hands of a committee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the assembly, in disregard of Howe's authority. As it appeared
to Page, there was a determined effort to set aside the authority of
the postmaster general and to take over the management of the
system by the government. Howe at Page's instance, took a
firm stand and informed the governor that, in case of conflict
between the directions he received from England, and those given
by the governor, it was the directions from St. Martins-le-Grand
he was bound to obey.</p>

<p>The disappointment in the general post office over the failure
of the plan to remove the difficulties with the government of
Nova Scotia, which was largely due to the hopeless complication
of the accounts, changed the attitude of the officials at home
towards Howe from one of good will to one of censure, which reached
the point that nearly determined them to dismiss Howe.</p>

<p>Page pointed out the injustice of such a step. Howe's position
was one in which it was impossible to escape criticism from either
the provincial authorities or his official superiors, whose views were
frequently in sharp antagonism to one another. The part of the
provincial system under Howe as deputy of the postmaster general
in England had its accounting scheme, and the part, which was
maintained by the legislature, had another, separate and distinct.</p>

<p>But the passing of letters between the recognized post offices
and those established by the legislature, gave rise to accounts
between the two systems under Howe's management, which it
was practically impossible to adjust satisfactorily, unless by the
adoption of a give-and-take system, to which neither the general
post office nor the legislature showed any disposition.</p>

<p>Howe's death in January 1843 closed the question as to whether
or not his administration was deserving of censure. It also brought
to an end an era, within which the postal service had expanded
from the single route extending from Halifax to Annapolis and
Digby, over which the mail courier travelled but once a month,
to the network of routes whose ramifications covered every part
of the province.</p>

<p>Judged by the only possible test, the administration of the
Canadian service under Heriot, Sutherland and Stayner, the
administration of the two Howes must be pronounced a conspicuous
success. The deputies in Canada were faithful to their superiors
in London, but they were so at the expense of the popularity of the
postal service in the provinces.</p>

<p>The Howes managed to extend their service equally with their
Canadian colleagues, and at the same time held the good will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the authorities in the province. Howe was a man who left no
enemies. The governor, in discussing the postal difficulties of
the province with Page, expressed the utmost good will for Howe
himself, the only ground of complaint against him being an
embarrassing intimacy with the members of the legislature.</p>

<p>Page, who visited Nova Scotia for the purpose of inspecting
Howe's administration, bore testimony, before Howe's death, to
his kindly disposition and to the high respect in which he was
held, officially and in private life. His rectitude in all his relations
was never in question.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Howe's successor was Arthur Woodgate, who had served in the
post office in Jersey. Woodgate administered the post office in
Nova Scotia until the provincial system was absorbed in that of
the dominion, when the confederation of the several provinces
took place; until 1851, he was, as were his predecessors, deputy of
the postmaster general in England; after that date he was postmaster
general for the province of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>An immediate consequence of the death of Howe was the
removal of the post office in Halifax from the site it had occupied
to the Dalhousie college building. The merchants objected to
the continuance of the post office in its former situation, and in
the search of a more convenient location, it was observed that the
ground floor of the college building, which was occupied as a tavern,
offered advantages, which satisfied the mercantile community.</p>

<p>A lease was effected for the new quarters on the 6th of July,
1844, and the post office surveyor reported to the secretary that
there was at the disposal of the department, a large and capacious
room solely for the purposes of the inland sorting office; a delivery
office, and a large room for sorting papers, all on the ground floor;
while in the second storey there was ample accommodation for
the deputy postmaster general and his staff.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The question of a reduction in the postage rates engaged the
attention of the legislature every session, after the beneficial
results of penny postage in Great Britain became known. In
March 1842, the assembly, which was at this time under the
speakership of Joseph Howe, petitioned to have the charges taken
entirely off newspapers and pamphlets. As newspapers were
almost the only vehicles of information in the province, and the
postal charges were collected entirely from the rural parts, they
were a heavy burden on people who could least bear it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>The postmaster general in reply stated that the proposition to
relieve newspapers altogether from postage could not be considered,
but a reduction in the charge was at that time being considered
by the treasury. Newspapers were increasing so rapidly, at the
existing rates, that it was becoming a question, with the bad state
of the roads, as to how to provide for their transmission. Pamphlets
were being charged as letters in England, and it would be impossible
to sanction their free conveyance in the colonies.</p>

<p>At the same time the assembly requested the lieutenant governor
to have inquiries made as to the feasibility and effect on the revenue
of a uniform rate on letters of fourpence per half ounce within the
province. The deputy postmaster general, to whom the question
was referred, was strongly opposed to the proposition. He was
convinced that the increase in the correspondence would be slight,
and that, at the rate mentioned, the revenue would not be sufficient
to pay the cost of any one of the principal routes in the province.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1844, the changes, already mentioned,
of charging letters by weight instead of number of enclosures,
and of charging newspapers a halfpenny per sheet, came into
operation in the Maritime provinces. These ameliorations went
as far as the officials of the post office were prepared to recommend,
in the existing state of the finances of the provincial post office.
The assembly in Nova Scotia were persistent in their demand for a
reduction in the charges on letters. They had before them the
evidence taken that year in England as to the effect of penny
postage, which had then been in operation three years.</p>

<p>The resolutions the assembly adopted were fully borne out by
that evidence. They resolved that the experience of the parent
state had clearly established that "the introduction of a uniform
rate of penny postage has had a beneficial effect upon the social
and commercial classes of the United Kingdom; has largely increased
the number of letters passing through the post office and
prevented the illicit transmission of letters by private opportunities,
and that its effect has been fully counterbalanced by the other
important consequences resulting from it."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The assembly were therefore satisfied that a fourpenny rate
established under the same regulations as to the use of postage
stamps, would promote the public interests, not add materially
to the labour of management, and ultimately increase the public
revenue.</p>

<p>Coupled with this resolution was another to the effect that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
would be desirable to have the provincial post office under the
control and management of the legislature. With this point,
the secretary of the post office dealt at length in a memorandum
to the postmaster general.</p>

<p>In his opinion very great advantage resulted from the present
system, by which the control of the post offices in the greater part
of the British colonies was vested in the postmaster general. To
abandon it would be extremely prejudicial, and would have the
effect of breaking up the existing organization (which he was at
that time endeavouring to make as uniform as possible for the
whole empire) into various conflicting systems framed according
to the views and feelings of each separate colony, to the great
detriment of the general interests of the empire.</p>

<p>Loud complaints, the postmaster general was reminded by the
secretary, were being made respecting the post offices in
Australia, where four different scales of rates of postage were in
operation, resulting in inconveniences which a recently appointed
commission of inquiry were authorized to obviate. He regarded
it as a great advantage that one uniform system of management
and one uniform scale of rates of postage should prevail in the
North American provinces, in Newfoundland and in the West
Indies.</p>

<p>The reply of the postmaster general, which was based on the
secretary's report,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> received the cordial assent of the legislature.
After reviewing the condition of the colonial post offices in their
relation to the imperial system, the postal committee of the legislature
declared that "the promptness and celerity of intercourse
is unrivalled in the world, and has greatly contributed to the
commercial advancement of the nation. So complicated is the
British postal system that, without the details, it is not possible to
obtain a conception of its present perfection. Nowhere is inviolability
of letters more respected than in England and the United
States, and by the constitution of the latter, adopted in 1789,
exclusive power is given to congress to establish post offices and
post roads, thus preventing the difficulties which would have
resulted from leaving this department to the several states."</p>

<p>On this point, then, the committee advised that the house
should yield to the wisdom of the imperial parliament. They
returned, however, to the question of a uniform fourpenny rate
for letters, which in their opinion would facilitate intercourse,
and ultimately carry the revenue far beyond the amount expended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
for the maintenance of the service. Since Hill made the use of
postage stamps an integral and important part of his scheme for
penny postage, the legislature, in again expressing its faith in
the benefits and feasibility of the uniform fourpenny rate, directed
attention to the merits of postage stamps.</p>

<p>The postmaster general was of opinion that this suggestion
should not be entertained. Any proposal for allowing postage
stamps to be used in the colonies had hitherto been resisted from a
fear, amongst other objections, that forged stamps would find
their way into circulation with little fear of detection. The
solicitor of the post office was of opinion that if forgery were
committed in the United Kingdom it could not be punished in
the colonies, whilst on the other hand, if committed in any of
the colonies, it could be visited with no penalty on parties in the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>With the acquiescence of the Nova Scotia legislature in the
view of the general post office as to the desirability of maintaining
a centralized imperial postal system, and the only outstanding
question on which there was disagreement that of a reduction of
postage rates, it will be expedient to bring forward the narrative
of events with respect to the post office in New Brunswick. The
information amassed by the royal commission makes this an
easy task.</p>

<p>What strikes one at first glance is the little progress that had
been made since 1825, when Howe made his official tour through
the province. In 1825, the population stood at 75,000, and in
1841 it had risen to nearly 160,000. The increase was distributed
with considerable evenness over every part of the province, though
the preponderance found its way to the outlying districts. The
numerous settlements thus established would seem to call for a
wide extension of the postal service.</p>

<p>But little was done to meet the requirements. There were
nine post offices in the province in 1825: in 1841, when the population
had more than doubled and was scarcely less than half what
it is to-day, there were no more than twenty-three. Between
Fredericton and Woodstock, a stretch of sixty-two miles of well-settled
country, there were no post offices. The districts lying
between Fredericton and Sussexvale, eighty-eight miles, and between
Fredericton and Chatham, one hundred and fifteen miles,
embracing many farming communities, were equally unprovided
for, which is the more inexplicable since couriers travelled through
all these districts to the several points mentioned, and the expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
for post offices would have been more than covered by the revenues
of the offices.</p>

<p>The system of mail routes can be described shortly. From
Halifax there was a main post road, which entered New Brunswick
a few miles west of Amherst, and following in its general lines the
course of the inter-colonial railway passed the bend at Moncton, and
continued its way on to St. John. At a point near the present Norton
station, called the Fingerboard, there was a route to Fredericton.</p>

<p>Over these routes the courier travelled twice each way weekly.
Between Fredericton and Chatham, there was a service of the same
frequency. Chatham was the distributing point for the line of
settlements, skirting the shore, northward to Campbellton, and
southward to Dorchester. On the former route, the trips were
made weekly, and on the latter, twice a week. Mails were carried
daily between Fredericton and Woodstock, Fredericton and St.
John and St. John and St. Andrews.</p>

<p>Though, in comparison with the other provinces, the mail
conveyance in New Brunswick was not greatly open to criticism
in point of frequency, the post office was no more popular there
than elsewhere. Steamers, which ran daily between St. John and
Fredericton, were employed by the post office to carry the mails,
but though the steamer carried many every trip, there were few
of which the post office got the benefit.</p>

<p>There was a practice of taking letters to the steamer and tossing
them on to the table in the cabin. On the arrival of the steamer
in port, a crowd of messenger boys who were awaiting it picked
up the letters from the table and delivered them through the town
at one penny or twopence each.</p>

<p>The stage coaches were laid under contribution in the same
irregular manner. Every passenger between St. John and Fredericton
was expected to take with him all his friends' letters, which
he either delivered to the persons to whom they were addressed,
or deposited in the post office, the postmaster receiving a penny
each for delivering them. A stratagem sometimes employed was
to place letters in the midst of a bundle of paper and sticks of wood,
the freight of the bundle being less than the postage on the letters
it contained.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the legislature of New Brunswick began
to manifest an interest in the management of the post office.
In 1841, a special committee of the assembly reviewed the operation
of the system, and among the questions discussed was the authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>The committee expressed the opinion that no arrangement
could be satisfactory which did not combine provincial control
of the local post office with a general imperial oversight over the
whole system; and they recommended that a deputy postmaster
general should be appointed whose duty it should be to prescribe
mail routes, open post offices, appoint postmasters, and generally
to manage the business of the post office in the province.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The question of local management the general post office
proposed to solve, not in the manner desired by the assembly, but
by separating New Brunswick from the jurisdiction of the deputy
postmaster general at Halifax, and establishing a department in
the province, under a deputy postmaster general who should be
stationed at St. John, and who should be, as the deputies in
the other provinces were, subject to the postmaster general of
England.</p>

<p>Local control was partially effected, as in the other provinces,
by vesting the appointment of all officials, except the deputy
postmaster general and the inspector, in the lieutenant governor.
On the 6th of July, 1843, a separate establishment was set up in
New Brunswick with John Howe, the son of the late deputy postmaster
general for Nova Scotia, in charge as deputy postmaster
general.</p>

<p>The arrangement had, at first, only a qualified success. It was
criticized by the legislature as having nearly doubled the expense
of the establishment, and by the post office officials on the ground
that it introduced the local politician into the system.</p>

<p>As illustration of the introduction of local political mechanics,
Page reported to the secretary of the post office that the deputy
postmaster general, having had to dismiss a postmaster for very gross
mismanagement, applied to the lieutenant governor for a nomination
for the vacant office.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The lieutenant governor nominated the
dismissed man, and when the nomination was refused, he proposed
to appoint the late postmaster's son. The explanation was that the
postmaster was a leading politician, and his re-nomination had been
insisted upon by the political manager, whom the governor
consulted.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor viewed with no favour the independent
powers of the deputy postmaster general. In the course of a
dispute over the dismissal by the deputy postmaster general of a
person whom he had appointed, the lieutenant governor laid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
opinions and desires energetically before the colonial secretary.
He requested that the general post office should be removed from
St. John to Fredericton in order that the latter might be more
effectually under the control of the lieutenant governor; and
that the post office surveyor or inspector should make his reports
to himself and not to the deputy postmaster general. His views
were held to be quite untenable, the postmaster general pointing
out that if carried into effect, they would make the governor the
deputy postmaster general.</p>

<p>St. John and Fredericton were the only towns in New Brunswick
in which correspondence was delivered by letter carrier. In St.
John there were two carriers, who covered the city together,
one delivering letters, the other newspapers. They were paid a
penny for each letter or newspaper. In Fredericton there was only
one carrier, who was in the employ of the postmaster, who retained
the sums collected as his own perquisite.</p>

<p>New Brunswick was in no respect behind the sister provinces
in its demand for the essential thing&mdash;a reduced rate of postage.
The chamber of commerce of St. John, in 1841, petitioned the postmaster
general to reduce the rate on letters exchanged between any
of the post offices on the route between St. John and Halifax to
threepence, arguing that British letters for places anywhere in the
colonies were carried from Halifax inward for one penny (the rate
was really twopence), and that letters were exchanged between the
remotest places in the United States for one shilling and threepence.</p>

<p>To the point respecting the conveyance of British letters, the
postmaster general replied that this part of the service was carried
on at a heavy loss, which was only to be justified as an imperial
measure.</p>

<p>A legislative committee sitting in the same year went beyond
the chamber of commerce in its recommendations.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> It was of
opinion that there should be a uniform rate on letters circulating
within the province, and that that rate should not exceed twopence.
They, also, recommended that newspapers, legislative papers and
small pamphlets, being for the political education of the people,
should be exempt from postage altogether. They foresaw a
temporary loss if their recommendations were carried into effect,
but considered that any such loss should be made good by the
legislature.</p>

<p>In 1843 the legislature took up the subject again, repeating
their desire for free newspapers, and requesting that the rate on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
letters exchanged within the province be fixed at threepence a
single letter.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The assembly, in 1845, addressed the king on the whole question
of the post office.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> After remonstrating on the large increase in
the cost of the provincial service, as the result of erecting a separate
establishment, they complained that, in order to bring the expenditure
within the revenue, the department had cut off several routes
and reduced the frequency of the couriers' trips on others. The
charges on letters and newspapers were so high as to impede
correspondence.</p>

<p>The assembly in this address gave it as their opinion that if
the charges on letters were reduced by one-half, and were abolished
altogether as regards newspapers, the receipts would soon be greater
than they were. The legislature had expended £145,000 on the
main roads during the preceding ten years, and it was disheartening
that the postal accommodation was less than it had formerly
been.</p>

<p>In their requests in 1845 for reduction of charges, the legislature
were more conservative than they had been in earlier sessions.
Still maintaining that newspapers should circulate free of postage,
they were content to ask that the charges on letters should range
from sixpence to twopence, according to the distance they were
carried. They asked that the deputy postmaster general be required
to establish such additional service as the legislature might
see fit to demand; that the accounts of the provincial system be
laid annually, in full detail, before the legislature, and that any
surplus revenue be devoted to extending the facilities for inter-provincial
communication. In consideration of the foregoing
requests being granted, the legislature pledged themselves to provide
such additional sums as might from time to time be required
to defray the current charges.</p>

<p>The colonial office replied to this address in October of the
same year.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The principal points dealt with were the petition for
free newspapers, and the complaint that the accommodation to
the public had been diminished.</p>

<p>On the latter point, the colonial secretary stated that no services
had been affected, except where they were unnecessary. As for
the question of free newspapers, if New Brunswick could be dealt
with separately from the other provinces, there could be no objection
to meeting their wishes, but in view of the fact that the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
on the other provinces had to be considered, the request of New
Brunswick could not be granted.</p>

<p>The legislature in the following session took issue with the
colonial secretary on this point. It was quite open to Nova Scotia
or any of the other provinces to adopt the same policy as New
Brunswick considered advisable. The legislature took a course,
which had not hitherto been pursued by the other provinces.
They besought the co-operation of a sister province in an effort to
have their desires carried into effect. They sent a copy of the
address of the previous session to Canada and suggested a joint
effort to secure reduced rates for the North American colonies,
by guaranteeing a sufficient sum in proportion to the business of
the respective provinces to make up any deficiency of a temporary
nature that might be caused by such reduction.</p>

<p>The post office in Prince Edward Island was involved in none of
the controversies, which agitated the people of the other provinces.
It owed its immunity to its low estate. Its revenues were never
equal to the cost of its maintenance, and consequently it was not a
subject for exploitation. A post office was opened at Charlottetown
in the beginning of the nineteenth century, and until 1827 it
was the only institution of the kind in the island.</p>

<p>Letters addressed to persons dwelling outside of Charlottetown,
no matter how far, remained in the post office in that town until
called for. This state of things led to many inconveniences, but
it was not until 1827 that it received official attention.</p>

<p>Lieutenant governor Ready, in the course of his speech at
the opening of the legislature in that year, pointed out the necessity
of establishing a postal system in the island, "as affording the
means of a speedy and safe communication with our distant population,
and of conveying to them a knowledge of the laws and proceedings
of the government, which, while it contributes to the
security of the people, serves also to guard them against the effects
of misrepresentation and misconception."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>The legislature having expressed their concurrence in these
views, the postmaster of Charlottetown was directed to open a number
of post offices, and establish the necessary courier routes. The
system began operations on the 1st of July following.</p>

<p>There were three routes established. The western courier
exchanged mails at New London, Malpeque, Traveller's Rest
and Tryon River, his route being nearly ninety miles in length.
The eastern courier served St. Peter's Road, St. Peters, Bay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Fortune and Grand River. This route was upwards of one hundred
miles. The south-east courier travelled fifty-three miles, and
exchanged mails at Seal River and Three Rivers.</p>

<p>The couriers performed their services weekly in summer and
fortnightly in winter. The rates of postage were fixed by the
legislature without regard to the postmaster general of England,
and were twopence a letter and one-halfpenny a newspaper. The
report of these proceedings rather disturbed the deputy postmaster
general at Halifax, whose jurisdiction included Prince Edward
Island and who expressed his disapproval of the course pursued
by the authorities. He notified the postmaster of Charlottetown
that there was no power possessed by the government of any colony
of Great Britain to establish post offices and set up couriers, and
demanded to be furnished with the orders under which the postmaster
had acted.</p>

<p>The secretary of the general post office, in a letter to the postmaster
general, pointed out that the measures taken by the legislature
of Prince Edward Island were entirely illegal, but that it was
a question how far it might be expedient or politic to interfere in a
settlement where the deputy postmaster general had not thought
it necessary to establish internal communications; particularly
when the communications, if established, would probably not
produce revenue sufficient to cover the expenses.</p>

<p>He therefore suggested no interference be made for the present
with the arrangements in the island, and that Howe, the deputy
postmaster general, should watch the financial results of the system.
If it should appear that a revenue should arise, then the local
authorities might be advised that the postmaster general would
take the arrangements into his own hands, under the powers given
by his patent, and by various acts of parliament.</p>

<p>The postmaster general concurred, and Howe was duly instructed.
As it appeared at the end of the first year's operations,
that the revenue derived from the posts set up by the legislature
amounted to £268, while the expenses were £383, the postmaster
general decided to leave the service in the charge of the legislature,
with instructions to Howe to keep his attention alive to the subject
in case a change in the financial results might make it desirable for
the postmaster general to assert his authority.</p>

<p>The outcome of the negotiations was that the revenue collected
by the post office in its internal system was passed over to the
provincial treasury, which defrayed the cost of maintaining the
couriers. The situation remained unchanged until 1851, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
control of the post office was formally transferred to the colonial
legislature. The financial results of the system were at no time
of any considerable magnitude, and the expenses constantly outran
the revenue, though not sufficiently to make the post office a
serious burden on the provincial revenues. In the year 1850, the
total net receipts were £1441, and the expenditure was £1528.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Reversal of attitude of British government on post office control&mdash;Instructions
to Lord Elgin&mdash;Provincial postal conference&mdash;Control of post office
relinquished to colonies.</p></div>


<p>The ministry formed by Lord John Russell, which took office on
July 6, 1846, gave its immediate attention to the condition of the
post office in the North American colonies, and a few weeks after
taking office, Lord Clanricarde, the postmaster general, laid a
proposition before the treasury<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> which had for its object the
severance of the relations between the colonial system and the
general post office and the withdrawal of the latter from all responsibility
respecting the service in the provinces.</p>

<p>The reversal of policy in this case was as remarkable for suddenness
as that which, in the same year, had brought about the abolition
of the Corn Laws. As late as June 9, the secretary of the post
office submitted a proposition from Stayner for a substantial reduction
in the rates, with many doubts as to the propriety of accepting
it. He pointed out that it would involve, at least temporarily, so
great a shrinkage in the revenues, that the treasury would be faced
with alternatives almost equally distasteful, but one of which it
would be obliged to adopt. The treasury must be prepared either
to take on itself the deficits certain to arise, or must call upon the
colonial legislatures to meet them.</p>

<p>While the treasury was deliberating, a new postmaster general
supervened, who was quite prepared to face the idea of colonial
postal systems over which he ceased to have control. With the
insistent petitions from Canada and New Brunswick before him,
he came to the conclusion that the time had arrived when it was
no longer expedient for the general post office to continue responsibility
for postal systems, which had to subserve interests understood
only by those whom they concerned. With certain safeguards,
he had no fear for the impairment of imperial interests.</p>

<p>The course of reasoning by which Clanricarde reached the
conclusions he communicated to the treasury were as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
The unanimity of the demands of the colonial legislatures left no
doubt that the postage rates must undergo a very considerable
reduction; and there was equally little doubt that the consequences
of this reduction would be a diminution of revenue so considerable
that a large deficit would be inevitable. New Brunswick, the new
postmaster general recalled, had undertaken to make good its
portion of the deficiency, and there was every probability that the
other provinces would assume the same obligation.</p>

<p>In these deficiencies, however, in spite of the utmost good will
on the part of the provinces, lay the seeds of certain trouble. The
principle governing the establishment of a postal system, and its
expansion to meet local requirements, was fundamentally different
in a new country from the principle by which they were guided
at home. In a new country a postal system was expected to afford
the means of extending civilization, and to advance with equal
step with settlement, whereas in a long settled country, the postal
system followed in the train of civilization.</p>

<p>The consequence of this difference is naturally a frequent
clashing of opinion between the authorities at home and the
public in the colonies. Disputes were constantly arising as to
the extent of the accommodation to be given to new settlements,
the amount of the salaries to be paid to officials, and above all as
to the principle upon which new and expensive posts should be
established.</p>

<p>As to this last point, the general post office had just disposed
of an application, which threw a strong light on the different
elements, which had sometimes to be taken into consideration in
dealing with questions of extensions of the system in a country
like Canada.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Sir George Simpson, the deputy governor of the Hudson Bay
Company, represented that the company had a post at Sault Ste.
Marie, for which postal accommodation was desirable. The post
office having but one test to apply was disposed to reject the application
on account of the insufficiency of the prospective revenue
to cover the cost of the service.</p>

<p>Gladstone, at that time colonial secretary, sought information
from Lord Cathcart, administrator of the government, as to the
merits of the application and learned that, besides the Hudson
Bay interest, there were prospects of large mining developments
in the district, and that a body of troops was about to be sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
fort Garry, which would certainly require regular communication
with headquarters.</p>

<p>These were considerations which post office officials in Great
Britain would seldom have to take into account, and while the
accommodation was authorized in this case, owing to the standing
of its advocates, there would be many cases, where the necessity
would appear equally great to local authorities, which would not
impress the authorities at home sufficiently to cause them to
disregard their customary regulations.</p>

<p>Parenthetically it may be stated, as instances, that when the
North-West territories were taken over by Canada in 1869, it became
necessary to establish a mail service over a stretch of nine hundred
miles between Winnipeg and Edmonton, at a cost of $10,000
a year, while the revenue from the route would scarcely exceed
as many hundreds; and for many years after the Canadian
Pacific railway was carried to Vancouver in 1886, the expenditure
of the post office for the conveyance of mails into that country
exceeded the revenue by some hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>On this point the postmaster general says: "there is no more
fertile source of contention in the North American colonies than the
establishment of new posts; and if the means of extending such
posts throughout the colonies were provided by funds not of the
post office, but granted from the general colonial revenue, however
well administered a department might be, I fear it would constantly
be subjected to accusations of favouritism and of undue influences."</p>

<p>Clanricarde conceded that it would only be reasonable to expect
that the legislative assemblies would endeavour to ascertain whether
by rearrangements, or other alterations in the administration, the
deficiency would not be diminished, and whether economy could
not be introduced with respect to salaries. The struggle of members
for local advantages would heighten the feeling with which the
department administered from England would be regarded.</p>

<p>The postmaster general summed the situation up by declaring
his conviction that any measure producing a large deficiency in
the post office revenue would be tantamount to a surrender of the
administration by the postmaster general; and as he was of opinion
that the general colonial interests called for a large reduction in
the postage rates, he considered that it would be better that the
postmaster general should resign his control over the post offices
at once.</p>

<p>The imperial interests, which had determined the department
in the past to retain its control over the arrangements remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
undiminished strength; and in order to safeguard these, it would
be necessary to stipulate for certain conditions to which the colonies
would be required to agree, before the colonial post offices were
relinquished to the colonial legislatures.</p>

<p>The first was that correspondence passing between two colonies
through the territory of a third, should not be subject to a charge
on the part of the latter for transportation. This stipulation
ensured that an intermediate colony should not have the power to
compel the colonies on either side of it to raise their charges to
meet exorbitant rates for transportation.</p>

<p>The second condition was that, in the case of correspondence
passing between Great Britain and the colonies, the postage on
which was one shilling and twopence, the part of this amount,
which was for the inland conveyance, viz. twopence, should remain
in operation, unless the ordinary inland rate should be less than
twopence. In this case the correspondence to and from Great
Britain should have the benefit of the lower rate.</p>

<p>The third condition was that prepayment or payment on
delivery should be optional with respect to correspondence passing
from one province to another, and, in order to avoid complicated
accounts between the provinces, the practice should be for each
province to treat as its own all the postage it collected whether it
were on letters paid at the time of posting, or on letters from other
provinces, the postage of which, being unpaid at the office of posting
was collected at the office of delivery. The postmaster general
also suggested, as highly desirable, that a uniform system and rate
of postage should be maintained throughout the provinces.</p>

<p>As the proposition of the postmaster general provided for the
reservation to the treasury of the full amount of the packet postage,
part of which had until that time been used in the colonies to defray
the expenses of their services, there could be no objection in point
of finances to leaving to the colonies the control of their post
offices.</p>

<p>Lord Elgin, who came out as governor general in the beginning
of 1847, brought with him instructions to convey this information
to the several legislatures. In these instructions Lord Grey,
the colonial secretary, after alluding to the great change in the
economic policy of the United Kingdom towards the colonies as a
consequence of the adoption of the principle of free trade&mdash;the
abolition of the preferential tariff which the colonies had hitherto
enjoyed, and the concomitant removals of the restrictions, which
had existed on their trade with foreign countries&mdash;pointed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
that in order that they might reap the largest measure of benefit
from the greater freedom of trade, it was necessary that they should
be united for customs purposes, on lines perhaps similar to those
of the German Zollverein.</p>

<p>Grey further intimated that it was also desired, in order to
complete the commercial association of the colonies, that some
arrangement should be come to for settling the affairs of the post
office. He suggested that a conference of the representatives of
the colonies should be held in Montreal, to discuss these important
subjects, and to endeavour to arrive at some agreement as to the
principles to be adopted in giving effect to united colonial action.</p>

<p>Elgin delivered his message to the Canadian legislature in opening
the session of 1847, on the 4th of June. He stated that he was
enabled to inform the legislature that His Majesty's ministers
were prepared to surrender to the provincial authorities, the control
of the department in the colonies as soon as, by consent between
the several legislatures, arrangements should be matured for
securing to British North America the advantage of an efficient
and uniform postal system.</p>

<p>But before this official intimation reached the colonies, action
had been taken in one of them, on lines so closely parallel to those
defined in the letter of the postmaster general to the treasury, as
to suggest that Elgin, on his arrival in Boston on the 25th of
January, had at once despatched a message to Halifax, since, on
the 27th of January, the question of the post office was brought
up for discussion in the legislature of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed to inquire generally into the
conditions of the post office, and, particularly, into the advantage
of one general system being adopted for the colonies, and the best
means of accomplishing such an object.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Their task was to submit
such a scheme as should be likely to command the approval of
the other colonies and of the imperial authorities. This scheme
should be founded upon some principle of central supervision and
management of the various colonial post offices that would ensure
uniformity in their operations, security against conflict with the
general post office of the empire, and a proper degree of responsibility
of the local heads to their legislatures.</p>

<p>Addressing themselves first to the question of postage rates,
the committee at Halifax decided, though with some misgivings,
to recommend for adoption the rates proposed by the commission
approved by Sydenham to investigate the affairs of the post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
office. These rates were based on the principle of charging according
to the distance letters were carried.</p>

<p>The preference of the committee was for a single uniform rate.
But they were prepared to waive it, and adopt the rates proposed
by the commission, "because those suggestions had already
received the sanction of able men well acquainted with the subject,
because they believed their adoption would involve very great
benefits to the people of this colony, and because they believed
those suggestions were more likely to be concurred in by the
authorities in England, and by the other colonies, than would be
any that proceeded directly from themselves."</p>

<p>The concurrence of the legislatures of the other provinces should
be obtained in the recognition of common principles, and of the
necessity for an independent authority placed in one of the colonies,
whose function it should be to organize and centralize the department
within certain limits to be prescribed and defined.</p>

<p>The report of the committee was submitted to the assembly of
Nova Scotia on the 29th of March, and was adopted on all points,
except the important one of the rates of postage. The house was
not disposed to concur in the continuation of a system of postal
charges, which had been definitely abandoned in Great Britain and
the United States, and which had been condemned by every
public body in the colonies, which had considered the subject.
The assembly substituted for the rates proposed by the committee
the uniform rate of threepence, and were prepared to face such
deficits as should result. The lieutenant governor was requested
to send the resolutions to the other colonies, with the earnest
desire that they would be pleased to give them consideration.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June, the Nova Scotia resolutions were laid
before the Canadian legislature, and no time was lost in carrying
into effect the suggestion of a conference between representatives
of the colonies on the mainland. Wm. Cayley, the inspector
general of Canada (in practice the minister of finance), J. W. Johnston,
the solicitor general of Nova Scotia and R. L. Hazen, of the
executive council of New Brunswick, were appointed representatives
of their respective provinces.</p>

<p>These representatives of three of the four provinces met in
Montreal, on the invitation of Elgin; and in October, the result
of their deliberations was presented to the governor general.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>In considering the question of the establishment of an independent
management within the provinces, thus taking over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
functions of the general post office so far as they related to the
colonies, the delegates discussed the relative advantages of a scheme
of a central department for the four provinces with united revenue
and management such as then existed, or of one that would place
the management of the postal arrangements in the hands of the
local governments of each province, with no greater central control
than should be necessary for securing imperial and inter-colonial
interests.</p>

<p>The former of the two alternatives was rejected, as open to
practically all the objections that had arisen from the control being
continued in England. There was the further consideration that
the most practical security against an imprudent excess in postal
accommodation would be found in the consideration that undue
encroachments on the general revenue for the benefit of the postal
service would diminish the means required for other and not less
valuable purposes. This motive, powerful when confined within
the limits of a single province, might lose much of its force, were
the postal revenues of the four provinces gathered into one fund.</p>

<p>The other alternative appeared free from the objections mentioned.
The delegates, therefore, recommended that the post office
departments in the several provinces should be separate and distinct
from one another, and under the control, each, of its own
provincial government, which should appoint all officers, make
arrangements for mail service, pay all expenses, and retain all
collections, except the balances due to Great Britain on packet
postage.</p>

<p>For expenditures common to all the provinces, there should
be an office of central audit in Canada of which the postmaster
general of Canada should be the head. The duties of the office
were to audit the accounts of the several provinces, returns of
which should be presented annually to the different legislatures;
to collect and transmit to England the balances due from the four
provinces on the packet service; and, in concert with the postmaster
general in each province, to make all necessary arrangements
for the transmission of the mails along the chief or central route
from Canada to Halifax and between Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island.</p>

<p>This office was anomalous in character, implying the inability
of the several independent provincial departments to make all
necessary business arrangements among themselves, and when
the provinces assumed control of their post offices, it was not
established.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>In dealing with the question of the rates of postage, the delegates
had before them the various representations from the several
provinces as to the desirability of establishing, if possible, a low
uniform rate of postage; and the success of penny postage in
Great Britain and of the rates adopted in the United States in
1846 encouraged the belief that a low uniform postage would
not only confer immeasurable commercial and social benefits, but
would within a reasonable time be productive of a revenue ample
for all the needs of the service.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, agreed to recommend to their respective
governments the adoption of the threepenny or five-cent rate for
each half-ounce letter. Lest, however, any of the provinces should
fear for the financial results of conveying letters over the greater
distances for this sum, they confined their recommendation to letters
carried less than three hundred miles, leaving it optional to charge a
double rate for letters carried beyond that distance. For the purpose
of fixing the charge the provinces were to be regarded as one
territory.</p>

<p>No change was recommended in the charges on newspapers,
parliamentary documents, or other printed papers, but the several
legislatures were left free to exempt these from postage, if they
thought fit to do so. Prepayment or payment on delivery of
letters should be optional, and franking abolished.</p>

<p>The treasury to whom this report was submitted, approved of
the arrangements proposed, except that relating to the payment for
the British mails to and from the port of destination in America.
But they contented themselves with observing that this remained a
matter of negotiation between the home and the colonial departments;
and stated that as soon as the arrangements had been
sufficiently matured, the requisite steps would be taken for the
transfer of the postal communications to the provincial authorities.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia, which had taken the leading part in the negotiations
which had brought matters to the point they had reached,
again took up the leadership. On the 21st of March, 1848, the legislature
adopted the report of the commissioners, and directed the
attorney general to prepare a bill based on the view of Grey and
Clanricarde, pledging themselves to make good any deficiency
which might take place in the post office revenue of that province.</p>

<p>The bill to effect this arrangement was adopted by the legislature
on April 4.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Thus all necessary action on the part of that
province was complete, and the measure was ready to be put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
operation, as soon as the British government and the other colonies
had taken the necessary action on their part.</p>

<p>Following up the enactment of this measure, the Nova Scotia
legislature appointed James B. Uniacke, the chairman of the post
office committee, to visit Canada, and lay before the governor
general the views of Nova Scotia on the subject of the provincial
post office and to endeavour to settle with Canada the questions
necessary to be disposed of before the post office could be established.</p>

<p>Uniacke arrived in Montreal on the 8th of June, and had interviews
with Elgin and the executive council. Two days later the
council adopted a report drawn up in terms differing but slightly
from those of the commission of 1847, and recommending the adoption
of a uniform rate of threepence (five cents) throughout British
North America.</p>

<p>The other recommendations were the same as those submitted
by the committee, with the addition that postage stamps should be
issued for the use of the public. The council were of opinion that
the provisions recommended should be introduced in a bill, to be
laid before parliament, and expressed the hope that the postmaster
general might be given full discretionary powers in matters referring
to the colonial post office, and that Her Majesty's government might
be persuaded to adopt the above rates and regulations without
further delay, the council pledging the administration to make good
any excess of expenditure over revenue which may possibly arise in
carrying out such arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The government of Nova Scotia then approached that of New
Brunswick, the lieutenant governor at Fredericton being informed
of the result of Uniacke's visit to Canada and that all that was now
required was the assent of the government of New Brunswick and
the approval of the imperial authorities. The governor general
added a word to the intimation of the lieutenant governor of Nova
Scotia, and it was settled that legislation would be introduced into
the New Brunswick legislature in accordance with the terms agreed
upon.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>All requisite measures for establishing the colonial post offices
on an independent footing were matured, so far as could be done,
by the legislatures themselves, and nothing now remained but
the imperial sanction. This the law officers were of opinion would
require an act of the imperial parliament, and on the 28th of July,
1849,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> an act was passed empowering the legislative authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in any of the colonies to establish and maintain a system of posts,
to charge rates of postage for the conveyance of correspondence,
and to appropriate to their own uses the revenue to be derived
therefrom. With this action taken, the control of the imperial
government over the colonial posts should cease and determine.</p>

<p>The government of Prince Edward Island, though invited by
Elgin to participate in the conference at Montreal in October
1846, took no part in it. In November 1847, Johnston, one of the
representatives from Nova Scotia, sent to the lieutenant governor
a copy of the report of the Montreal commission, requesting an
expression of his sentiments, and inquiring as to the prospect of
the legislature concurring in the opinions contained in the report.</p>

<p>The deputy postmaster general in the course of an examination
of the report pointed out that the only valid objection the government
of Prince Edward Island could have to the adoption of its
conclusions, was that the uniform charge of threepence on inter-colonial
correspondence would make a serious inroad in the receipts
of the Prince Edward Island post office.</p>

<p>The island post office had been in the practice of adding to the
postage charged on inter-colonial letters, the inland rate of twopence
a letter. If the terms of the report were adopted in their entirety,
and a uniform rate were charged throughout the provinces of threepence
a letter, the island would have to relinquish its inland
charge.</p>

<p>The deputy postmaster general took a serious view of the effect
of the proposed relinquishment of the inland postage. The revenue
for 1850 was £1440. Applying his estimates of the proportions by
which the receipts from the several classes of correspondence would
be reduced, he concluded that, under the scheme submitted, the
revenue would probably not exceed £660.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding this unfavourable anticipation, the government
gave its assent to the scheme agreed upon by the other
colonies, and the rate of postage on letters exchanged with other
colonies became threepence per half ounce, while the charge on
letters exchanged within the island remained twopence per half
ounce.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Provincial administration of the post office&mdash;Reduced postage&mdash;Railway mail
service&mdash;Arrangements with United States.</p></div>


<p>The several provinces took over the post offices within their
territories in 1851, Canada on the 6th of April, and Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick three months later. The postmaster general of
Canada was made a member of the executive council&mdash;the provincial
cabinet&mdash;from the beginning. The postmaster general of
Nova Scotia was never a member of the council, but administered
the department as a subordinate official. In New Brunswick,
the department was administered on the same plan until 1855,
when the postmaster general was made a member of the government.</p>

<p>During the period of separate provincial administrations, which
continued until 1867, when they were merged in the post office
department of the dominion of Canada, the record is on the whole
one of steady uneventful progress. Postal accommodations were
extended, always as occasion demanded, and seldom as immediate
prospective revenues warranted, with the result that the expenses
generally outran the revenues. This condition, however, caused
little or no discontent, as the provincial governments realized, as
the British government could not, that on the efficiency of the
postal service depended in no small measure the welfare of their
people.</p>

<p>Stayner, in his valedictory to the postmasters of Canada, took
credit for the thriving and effective state in which he left the post
office. He believed that the improvements had fully kept pace
with the growth of the country during the period of his administration.
In that period, he pointed out, the increase in the number
of post offices, amount of revenue, and in the number of miles
annually travelled with the mails was more than six hundred per
cent., a measure of progress not exceeded by any public institution
within the province.</p>

<p>Stayner's words contained no more than the truth. When he
entered on the office of deputy postmaster general he brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
with him considerable experience as a subordinate in the service.
He gained early, and retained to the end, the esteem and confidence
of his superiors in England, and if he lost popularity for a period
in this country, it was because he saw the folly of trying to serve
two masters.</p>

<p>No one perceived more keenly than Stayner the inadequacy of
the accommodation he was permitted to extend to the rapidly
expanding settlements of the country; and no one could be more
persevering in bringing the facts to the attention of the postmaster
general. The contrast between the mail service on the north and
south side of lake Ontario affected him, as it did the people of
Kingston and Toronto, and he risked the regard of St. Martins-le-Grand
by expressing sympathy with the general feeling. The
postal accommodation, which did not hold out the prospect of, at
least, self-maintenance, the authorities there did not desire to have
brought to their notice.</p>

<p>While sharing the general sense of the necessity of postal communication
in many parts of the country, Stayner took on himself the
blame that they were not provided. Fortunately for him, he was
abundantly able to take care of himself. By attaching himself to
the government party he earned a measure of the odium, which
fell on them. But he entrenched himself against too violent attack,
and secured champions whom the British government would willingly
listen to. He managed to secure a very large income from
obnoxious perquisites, but it would seem from later developments
that this was rather a matter of good fortune, than of any deliberate
effort on his part.</p>

<p>The postmaster general and the colonial secretary had the
strongest objections to these perquisites, but when they sought
the means to get rid of them, they tried for some years in vain.
The perquisites would fall to somebody, since they were of the
appurtenances of that position.</p>

<p>That Stayner served the country, as well as his relations with the
department in England would permit, admits of no doubt. William
Lyon Mackenzie, who abhorred the post office and all its ways, was
fain to concede that Stayner was the man, whom, of all he knew, he
would most readily support for the position of deputy postmaster
general.</p>

<p>With how vigorous a hand the postmaster general of Canada
set about his task of providing adequate postal accommodation
for the country, may be judged from the fact that the number of
post offices which in 1851 was six hundred and one, was increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
to eight hundred and forty-four during the first twelve months.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
The system was extended in Canada as far west as Kincardine.
The courier services to Sarnia and Goderich on lake Huron were
made daily, as was that to Bytown (afterwards Ottawa).</p>

<p>Within five years the number of post offices had risen to one
thousand three hundred and seventy-five; and in 1861, ten
years after the postal service was taken over by the Canadian
government, the number had been augmented to one thousand
seven hundred and seventy-five offices, practically threefold the
number in operation in 1851. When Canada entered confederation
it took into the postal system of the dominion two thousand
three hundred and thirty-three post offices.</p>

<p>The people of Canada responded with great readiness to the
invitation to use the post office, which was offered through the
reduction in the charges. When the Canadian post office was
taken over, the rates varied according to the distance letters were
carried. The postmaster general estimated that they yielded on
the average ninepence a letter. The reduction to threepence was,
therefore, a diminution of two-thirds.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy how completely fulfilled was the prediction
that the low rates would so increase the number of letters carried
that, in a short time, the revenue, which was certain to fall for the
moment, would recover itself and return to the figures of 1851.
For the year ending April 1851, the last year of the high rates, the
revenue was $335,208. In the following year, with the reduction
of the rate to one-third of what it had been, the revenue fell to
$239,608. But it was observed that the number of letters posted
had increased by over fifty per cent.</p>

<p>In 1855 the effect of the reduction, coupled with the extension
of the facilities to the public, was to produce a revenue of $368,168.
Ten years after the great reduction in the rates the revenue had
risen to $683,035, and at the time of entering confederation it was
$914,784.</p>

<p>Among the most important of the facilities introduced in 1851
were postage stamps, the values being threepence, sixpence, and one
shilling. Curiously enough, the obvious advantages of postage
stamps did not strike the people at the time. This is in large
measure accounted for by the fact that the use of stamps involved
a change in attitude on the question&mdash;who should pay the postage.</p>

<p>The old theory was that the service rendered to an individual by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
the post office should not be paid for until the letter was actually
delivered. There was always a certain proportion of letters the
postage of which was paid at the time they were handed in at the
post offices, but the proportion was small. The regular practice
was to allow the recipient of the letter to pay for it.</p>

<p>This attitude had to be overcome, and natural conservatism
delayed the change for some time. Indeed, it was not until a fine
in the shape of additional postage was imposed in cases where
letters were not prepaid, that the practice was entirely changed.</p>

<p>The charges on the transmission of newspapers in Canada
were among the matters that received early attention. There was
a strong feeling throughout the colonies, that, in the absence of
libraries, the high price of books precluded their general diffusion
in the several communities, and it was therefore necessary that
newspapers, the only remaining means for extending public information
should be distributed at the cost of the government.</p>

<p>In the agreement on the conditions, under which the several
colonies should assume the administration of their post offices, it
was stipulated that, while threepence should be the charge on
letters, and one-halfpenny on newspapers, the several legislatures
should have the power to provide for the free circulation of newspapers
through the post offices.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia abolished the charges altogether when she took over
control; and New Brunswick took the same measure with the
restriction that the newspapers to which the free conveyance
would apply should not exceed two ounces in weight.</p>

<p>In Canada the same end was reached but with more deliberation.
The rate charged at the close of the old regime&mdash;one-halfpenny per
sheet&mdash;was continued until 1854. In that year this rate was
reduced on general newspapers, and was abolished altogether
on periodicals devoted exclusively to the furtherance of the special
objects of agriculture, education, science and temperance. The
postmaster general calculated that this measure would reduce
the revenue by $32,000. In the year following, the final step was
taken, and the charges on provincial newspapers circulating within
the British North American colonies were removed altogether.</p>

<p>The money order system was established in Canada in 1855, on
the plan of that in operation in the United Kingdom. The amount
which might be sent by a single order was limited to $40, and
there was a uniform charge of twenty-five cents for each order.
In 1857, the amount transmissible by single order was raised to
$400, but after a short experience, it was reduced to $100, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the charges were fixed at one-half of one per cent. for the smaller
amounts, and at three-quarters of one per cent. for amounts
above $30.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1857, a money order exchange was established
between Canada and the United Kingdom, the limit of a
single order being fixed at $20. This was an accommodation
which had been called for for a number of years.</p>

<p>The colonial secretary, as early as 1852, wrote to the postmaster
general of England, pointing out the large increasing emigration
to the colonies, and the desire of persons prospering there to assist
their relatives to follow them. He estimated that over £1,000,000
was sent yearly through the agency of private firms for this purpose.
This the colonial secretary declared to be worthy of encouragement,
and he asked the postmaster general to consider the question of
extending to the colonies the system of money orders which had
proved so successful in Great Britain. This appeal produced no
immediate result.</p>

<p>In 1855, a registration system was introduced. Long previous
to this time, there had been a practice of entering money letters
on letter bills accompanying the mails, but as receipts were not
given to those posting such letters, nor taken from those to whom
they were delivered, the practice was defective as a measure of
safety. Under the regulation of 1855 receipts were given and taken,
the charge being two cents.</p>

<p>The greatest advantage the post office was enabled to extend
to the public during this period was due to the opening of railway
lines. For some years progress in this respect was tardy. The first
line built ran from Laprairie, opposite Montreal to St. John's.
It was constructed in 1836, and its purpose was to improve the
communications between the Canadian metropolis and the cities
of New England and of the state of New York.</p>

<p>No further steps were taken in this direction until 1847, when
another link was laid in the connections between Montreal and the
eastern states by the building of a line between Montreal and
Lachine. These two short lines, with one opened the same year
between Montreal and St. Hyacinthe, were all the railway lines in
operation in Canada until 1851.</p>

<p>During this and the following year, additional lines were laid,
but their object was still the same, to improve the facilities for
transportation between Montreal and the cities of the United States.
The line from Montreal to St. Johns was extended to Rouse's Point,
New York, on lake Champlain, and that to St. Hyacinthe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
carried on to Sherbrooke and the international boundary, where it
joined with the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railway (an American
line), and opened a connection by railway between Montreal and the
Atlantic seaboard at Portland. This city became the winter port
of the Canadian steamship line, the operations of which began in
the winter of 1853.</p>

<p>Until 1853, no part of what could be described as the Canadian
railway system had been built. The lines then under operation were
all for the purpose of bringing Montreal within the benefits of
the American system. But this year&mdash;1853&mdash;three extensive
schemes of communication were begun: the Grand Trunk Company
started building the line running from Quebec to the western limits
of the province at Sarnia; the Great Western Company built a line
across the Niagara peninsula from the Niagara river to Detroit
river; and the Northern Company, a line from Toronto northward
to Georgian Bay at Collingwood. These lines brought the advantages
of railway communication to every rising settlement in
Upper and Lower Canada.</p>

<p>As construction progressed the new lines were utilized by the
post office department until the completion, in October 1856, of
the Grand Trunk from Brockville and Toronto brought Quebec
into direct communication by means of the Great Western railway
with Windsor at the western end of the province.</p>

<p>The reduction in time, which the railways had made it possible
to effect in the delivery of the mails between Quebec and the leading
points in the western part of the province was great. In 1853
the ordinary time for the winter mails to travel from Quebec to
Kingston was four days; in 1857, they were carried between the
two places in thirty-one hours; to Toronto the saving in time was
the difference between seven days and forty hours. Before the
era of railways ten and a half days were occupied in the journey
from Quebec to Windsor. The railway carried the mails regularly
in forty-nine hours.</p>

<p>The use of travelling post offices, with mail clerks assorting and
distributing the mails from the railways in the course of their
trips, was an early feature of the postal service in Canada. This
mode of utilizing the railways had been in operation in England
since 1838, and before the leading railways in Canada were completed,
an officer of the post office department was sent to England
to study the system. Thus, by 1857, this system, which is the
leading feature of mail conveyance and distribution, was in full
course in this country seven years earlier than in the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>But gratifying as were the results from the use of railways in
the conveyance of mails, through the sparsely-settled districts
over the immense stretches of our territory, the substitution of
steam for horse conveyance introduced a perplexing financial
problem. The postmaster general noted the peculiar fact that
while passengers and merchandise reaped the benefit of improved
speed with an accompanying reduction in the expense, the change
threatened to burden the public with a vastly augmented charge
for the mail service.</p>

<p>Comparing the service by railway with that by stage, it was
noted that, while the stage driver waited at each office he visited,
until the mail he brought was assorted, and arranged for his farther
conveyance, it was impossible owing to the brevity of the stops
at the stations, to do this in the case of the mails carried by railway.</p>

<p>The post office consequently was compelled to train and employ
a distinct class of clerks to travel on the trains, and perform that
duty while the train was in movement. A portion of a car&mdash;generally
about one-third&mdash;was partitioned off and fitted up exclusively
for postal service. The salaries of these clerks constituted
what the postmaster general regarded as the enormous expenditure
of $32,000 a year; and the necessity created by the nature of the
railway service for the provision of an office on the trains, formed the
principal ground on which a comparatively high rate of compensation
was claimed by the companies.</p>

<p>But that was not all. The railways not being able, like the
stage coach, to exchange the mails directly with the post offices of
the towns along the line, side services of an expensive character
were required to maintain the connection between the post offices
and the stations. The expenditure for this class of service, coupled
with that for the employment of the clerks who travel on the railway,
exceeded, in most cases, the whole of the previous expenditure for
the superseded service by stage; and then there were the demands
of the railways to be satisfied.</p>

<p>The rate of compensation for the conveyance of the mails was
a subject of dispute between the postmaster general and the railway
companies. The claims of the latter, however legitimate, were
considered by the postmaster general as out of the power of the
department to meet from its revenues. Several tentative settlements
were made, but the final adjustments were not reached until
the appointment of a royal commission in 1865, which, after hearing
the statements of both sides, decided the terms on a basis which
lasted practically unchanged for nearly half a century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Nova Scotia entered on the administration of the postal service
of the province with much energy.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> There were one hundred
and forty-three offices in the province in 1851. These were
rapidly augmented and on the more important routes, that is,
those radiating from Halifax to the eastern and western ends of
the province, and to New Brunswick, were given a frequency,
conformable to the importance of the communications.</p>

<p>The number of post offices was in Nova Scotia doubled in four
years; trebled in ten years; more than quadrupled in fifteen years;
and had reached a total of six hundred and thirty when the provincial
office was absorbed into the postal service of the dominion.</p>

<p>Communication with Canada was confined to the land route,
seven hundred miles in length, over which it took ten days travel
to reach the nearest point of importance. By 1854, two other
modes of communication had presented themselves. The Cunard
steamers, which called at Halifax on their way to Boston and New
York, were laid under contribution to carry mails between Halifax
and Canada; and the completion of the railway between Montreal
and Portland, Maine, afforded an opportunity of a connection
which was made by a steamer running between Portland and St.
John, New Brunswick.</p>

<p>The value of this service was not as great as it afterwards became
when there was a complete railway connection between Halifax
and St. John, but it nevertheless effected a considerable reduction
in time. Thus, in November 1855, mails were carried between
Quebec and Halifax by way of St. John and Portland in four days,
though the average, through the winter, was about a day more.
The steamer carried the mails between St. John and Portland
three times a week in summer, and twice a week during the balance
of the year.</p>

<p>The postage on letters circulating throughout the North American
provinces was threepence a half ounce, and newspapers were transmitted
free of all postage. The registration of letters was introduced
in 1852, the fee being sixpence; and a money order system
established in 1859. The limit on the amount of a single order
was fixed at the low sum of $20 and the charge on each order was
the rather high one of tenpence an order.</p>

<p>By 1860 a fully equipped postal system was in operation in
Nova Scotia. The revenue of the department responded with fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
readiness to the accommodation afforded to the public. For the
last year under the old system, when rates were excessively high,
and the accommodation limited, the revenue was $28,260. The
immediate consequence of the great reduction was a shrinkage
in the revenue by $4856 in the following year. Five years after
the low rates were established, the revenue for the year 1851 was
surpassed, and in thirteen years it was practically doubled. In
1866, the last complete year under the provincial regime the revenue
had reached the respectable sum of $69,000.</p>

<p>The steady expansion of the service entailed an outlay which
considerably surpassed the revenue. In 1852, the first complete
year under the provincial administration, the deficit was $10,500.
This deficiency steadily mounted until for the years 1859 to 1861,
it averaged $29,000. Thereafter it descended as steadily as it
had risen, and during the last three years before the provincial
system was absorbed by the post office department at Ottawa the
shortage was $17,500 a year.</p>

<p>Neither Nova Scotia nor New Brunswick had the advantage of
an extended railway mail service until some years after Canada
had been in enjoyment of it. The service by railway began at the
commencement of 1857, the mails being carried between Halifax
and Grand Lake, a distance of twenty-two miles. In the following
year it was extended to Truro and Windsor, which was
the total extent of the railway mail service at the time of
confederation.</p>

<p>It was resolved at the time New Brunswick assumed the administration
of its postal system, to make the postmaster general a
member of the provincial cabinet. But the legislature did not
act on its resolution until 1855, the postmaster general in the interim
being, as in Nova Scotia, merely an officer of the government.
In 1851, the post office in New Brunswick had, in regular post offices
and way offices, exactly one hundred offices.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> These were increased
with much rapidity. After five years, the number had increased
to two hundred and forty-six offices; and at the period of confederation,
there were four hundred and thirty-eight post offices
in New Brunswick.</p>

<p>The conditions under which letters and newspapers were carried
in New Brunswick were the same as those which prevailed in the
other provinces. The postage was threepence per half ounce for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
letters, and newspapers were carried without charge. The effect
on the revenue was the same as in the other provinces.</p>

<p>In the first year after the low charges were introduced, the reduction
in the revenue was considerable. On comparing the revenue
for the first six months under the reduced rates with the revenue
for the corresponding period of the preceding year, there was
found to be a diminution of $3959. But the rebound was as rapid
as it was in Canada. In 1853, the revenue had nearly attained
the figures of 1850-1851. Thereafter the progress of the revenue
was steady, reaching the sum of $50,769 in 1866.</p>

<p>As in Nova Scotia, the cost of maintaining the service at its
existing efficiency outran considerably the revenue produced. The
deficiency of revenue to meet expenses amounted in 1854 to $15,316.
This shortage increased to nearly $24,000 in the years 1856 and
1857. There were variations during the years that followed, but
in the last three years the average annual deficit was rather more
than $20,000.</p>

<p>The department at Fredericton took a philosophical view of
these deficits which the government were called upon annually
to make good. The large expenditure, it was maintained, might
be fairly viewed in the same light as the amounts annually granted
by the legislature for roads and bridges and for the support of
common schools. "The mail carriage to all parts of the province
secures to the travelling public conveyances which would not
otherwise exist, and the very large amount of newspapers, etc.,
which passes through the post office affords strong evidence that
the department may be considered a branch of our educational
system."</p>

<p>Some friction existed between the three provinces, arising from
their geographical relations to one another. The British government
made an arrangement in 1845 for the conveyance of the
Canadian mails through the United States to and from the port
of Boston, paying the United States on the basis of the weight of
mails carried. The letters were carried under this arrangement.
But, as the newspapers were not regarded as so important, the
government decided that they should not be carried on to Boston,
but landed them at Halifax, leaving them to be carried by the
couriers who conveyed the mails overland from that city to Quebec.</p>

<p>It was an arrangement which gave no satisfaction to any of
the provinces. Nova Scotia complained that it had to bear the
expense of conveying this mail matter for Canada and New Brunswick
across its territory without any sort of compensation. New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Brunswick declared its case was no better than Nova Scotia's,
as it had to forward the Canadian matter through that province,
while Canada protested that the matter complained of was due to
no action or desire on its part, as the arrangements delayed the
delivery of the newspapers until they were useless. A combined
representation to the British government removed the grievance,
by the newspapers as well as the letters being thereafter sent by
way of Boston.</p>

<p>The relations between Canada and the United States were,
as was to have been expected, cordial. A convention was made
in 1848 between Great Britain and the United States, providing
for the conveyance of the mails exchanged between Canada and
Great Britain, and in this convention it was stipulated that the
letters and newspapers exchanged between Canada and the United
States should be subject to the combined postage of the two
countries.</p>

<p>Thus the postage on any letter weighing not more than half
an ounce, and sent from Canada to any part of the United States
was ten cents. An exception was made in the case of letters passing
between Canada and California and Oregon. The charge in these
cases was fifteen cents.</p>

<p>The construction of the Great Western railway between Niagara
Falls and Windsor afforded an opportunity to the United States
to improve its postal communications between the eastern and
the western States, while, on the other hand before the Grand
Trunk railway was built, Canada took advantage of the lines
in the United States running along the south shore of lake Ontario
to accelerate the mails exchanged between Toronto and Montreal.</p>

therewith.</p></div>


<p>The progress of the Cunard line had a consequence which was
neither anticipated nor welcomed by the British government.
The plan of the government to concentrate its transatlantic communications
on Halifax had been given a thorough trial and had
proven a failure, and as the expressed wish of the Canadians to
have their correspondence with the mother country exchanged at
either Boston or New York coincided with the interests of the owners
of the steamers, the principal port of call on this side of the Atlantic
shifted through a series of arrangements from Halifax to New York.</p>

<p>In 1852, the contract between the British government and the
Cunards provided for a direct service of weekly frequency between
Liverpool and New York, with a subordinate service by slower
steamers to Halifax and Boston. The subsidy had also undergone
successive augmentations until, in 1852, it reached the immense
sum of £173,340 a year.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> But although the service was now to
all appearances Anglo-American in character the British government
assumed to regard it as Anglo-colonial, as imperial, because
it provided the means for exchanging the mails between Great
Britain and Canada.</p>

<p>In 1855, the British government set on foot one of those large
colonial schemes which ought to have excited mistrust both as
to its practicability and its expediency. It proposed to establish
a low and uniform rate between Great Britain and all her dependencies
excepting India, Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius and Van
Diemen's Land. The postage was to be reduced from one shilling
to sixpence per half ounce letter.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Coupled with the reduction in rate was a proposal that arrangements
should be made by which the maintenance of the services,
which had hitherto fallen entirely upon the mother country, should
be shared by the colonies having the benefit of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>Canada's participation in the scheme was invited, and the
arrangement made by the British government with the Australian
colonies was submitted to the Canadian government.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Under
this arrangement the British government was to make the contract
for the service, and the colonies should pay half the expense involved.</p>

<p>The proposal found no favour in Canada. The Cunard service,
the expense of which Canada was expected to share, was far from
being an unmixed advantage to the British North American
provinces. It was indeed a most serious obstacle to the realization
of plans, which Canada conceived essential to its expansion on
the lines marked out by nature.</p>

<p>For many years the thought of Upper Canadians had turned
to the advantages which were to be derived from the utilizing of
the great water system extending through lake and river, from
the head waters of the lake Superior to the ocean, and measures
had been carried forward to overcome the obstacles caused by
the falls and rapids on the course of the passage.</p>

<p>By 1849, the canal system was completed, which permitted
the free passage of inland vessels from the upper lakes to Montreal,
and it was anticipated that the greater part of the movement of
immigration and freight to and from Upper Canada and the western
states, would be upon Canadian waterways. Merchandise could
be carried from lake Erie to Quebec at less cost than from Buffalo
by the Erie Canal to New York. But in spite of these facts, trade
on the Erie Canal increased largely and steadily, while the trade
on the Canadian water routes increased but slowly.</p>

<p>The principal reason for the apparent disregard of the economic
law that trade will follow the superior route was found in the fact
that for a large proportion of the traffic the destination was Europe,
and that the charges to the out-ports of New York and Quebec
were only a part of the total charge to which the traffic were subject.
If, for any reason, the conveyance across the Atlantic from New
York to Europe was so much cheaper than the conveyance from
Quebec, that the total charge from lake Erie to Europe was lower
by way of New York than by way of Quebec, then it is obvious
that the trade would not be attracted to the route which seemed
to be naturally the superior one.</p>

<p>This was the case at that time. Owing to the large subsidies
given by the British government to the steamers sailing to and
from New York, vessels running to and from Quebec could not
compete with those from the rival port. The assistance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Cunard line, therefore, which the British government desired
Canada to give in part, was a positive detriment to the development
of the transport business of upper and lower Canada.</p>

<p>The question of establishing a steamship line from a St. Lawrence
port had engaged the attention of the legislature of the United
Provinces as early as 1851. In that year a resolution was offered
to the house of assembly, setting forth the advantages of the
Canadian route, and the fact that these advantages were offset
by the aid given by the British government to the Cunard and
Collins lines (the latter was owned by an American company),
and asking that the British government be approached with a
request that they grant assistance to a Canadian line similar to
that given to the lines running in and out of New York.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>A committee of the assembly took the subject into consideration,
and in the following year a contract was made with a British
firm,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> which was shortly afterwards converted into the Canadian
Steam Navigation Company, for a service from Liverpool to Quebec
and Montreal during the season of open navigation in the St.
Lawrence, and to Portland, Maine, during the five months when
the river route was not practicable. The trips were to be fortnightly
to the Canadian ports and monthly to Portland; and the
steamers to be employed were to be of at least 1200 tons burthen.</p>

<p>Twenty-four thousand pounds a year were to be paid to the
company by way of subsidy&mdash;£19,000 by the government of Canada,
£4000 by the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railway (later a section
of the Grand Trunk railway) and £1000 by the city of Portland.</p>

<p>Trips were made during the winter of 1853, and throughout
the summer of 1854, but there was so general a disregard of the
terms of the contract, that it was terminated, and a contract was
made with Hugh Allan in September 1855.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The new contractor
entered upon his engagement with laudable energy; and at the
end of the first season the postmaster general of Canada was able
to make a comparison between the Canadian service and that to
the port of New York.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>On the westbound voyages the Canadian steamers were practically
a day slower than the Cunard steamers&mdash;the Allan steamers
taking twelve days, twenty and a half hours, to eleven days and
twenty-two hours occupied by vessels of the Cunard line. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Canadian steamers were also slower than the Collins line on these
trips by four hours. But on the voyage to Great Britain, the
Canadian line made the speediest trips of the three. These steamers
took but eleven days two hours, while the Cunard steamers were
eleven hours and the Collins thirty hours longer in reaching
Liverpool.</p>

<p>It was with the successful inauguration of the Canadian service
that the friction with the British government began. There
developed immediately a clash of interests.</p>

<p>The first note of dissatisfaction came from Great Britain. The
postmaster general communicated to the colonial secretary<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> the
information that the earnings of the packet service were much
reduced by the fact that the Canadian post office was sending its
correspondence by the first steamer that sailed whether it was
British or American, and not confining its despatches to the steamers
of the Cunard line.</p>

<p>To the British post office, the Canadian line was an American
line, and in spite of all protests and remonstrances, it insisted
on treating the Allan line steamers as foreign. Ordinarily there
would be no practical consequence of this wilful misunderstanding,
but as letters conveyed by the Cunard line were charged eightpence
the half ounce, while those carried by the American lines were
made to pay fourteen pence, the hostility to the Canadian enterprise
was marked.</p>

<p>The postmaster general did not stop at this point, and leave
the public on both sides of the Atlantic to consult their own interests
as to whether they would send their letters by the Canadian or
British subsidized lines. Taking up the case of interests adversely
affected by the discriminatory rates, he pointed out that, as many
unpaid letters were sent by the American lines, recipients of these
letters had to pay sixpence more than if the letters were sent by
the Cunard line.</p>

<p>That the remedy lay in the hands of the postmaster general, of
reducing the rates on letters carried by the Canadian (or American
line as he persisted in calling the Allan line) was not to the point.
He called upon the colonial secretary, if the secretary concurred
in his views, to remonstrate with the Canadian government as
to the course it has chosen without reference to the home government.
These views do not seem to have been communicated to
Canada. But shortly afterwards the British government submitted
for the consideration of the Canadian government, the Australian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
scheme for a postal service to practically all the self-governing
colonies of this period.</p>

<p>The postmaster general of Canada had doubts as to the applicability
of the Australian arrangement to the Canadian service.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
He presumed the proposition was limited to the Cunard line, and
would not be extended to the equally British line running directly
from Canadian ports to Liverpool. Special interests, similar to
those which had induced the British government to subsidize
the Cunard line, had led the Canadian government to extend assistance
to the Allan line, and it seemed scarcely expedient for the
Canadian government to lend aid to the British government in
the maintenance of the Cunard line in the absence of any evidence
of intention on the part of the British government to reciprocate
with regard to the Canadian line.</p>

<p>It was further observed by the postmaster general of Canada
that even if the Canadian government should concede the equity
of the British proposition it would be impossible to determine
satisfactorily the proportion of the cost which should be borne
by the North American provinces, since much the larger part of
the mails carried by the Cunard line was exchanged between Great
Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>The position taken by the Canadian government gave rise to
great irritation in Great Britain. Fortunately the expression
of this feeling was not communicated to the Canadian government
until some years later, when the question, though by no means
settled, had passed out of the irritation and friction phase.</p>

<p>It is fortunate, also, that the intermediaries between the two
governments were men of good sense, with an appreciative understanding
of the view of the colonial government. The Duke of
Argyle, postmaster general, in the Palmerston government of
1855-1858, declared that the measures taken by the Canadian
government afforded no relief whatever to the British government.
They had, indeed, withdrawn from the British government part of
the postage it was entitled to expect when it embarked on the
Cunard contract. If on the expiration of the contract existing,
which had still five or six years to run, the Canadian government
should undertake to perform half of the effective service, it might
fairly claim exemption from all share in the other half of the service,
and furthermore might claim a right to apply the amount received
by way of sea postage, towards defraying the cost of the Canadian
packets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>But, Argyle affirmed, the British government could hardly
admit the propriety of a demand made upon it for assistance to a
line of steamers, which was established by the colony&mdash;a line which
had no other effect than to diminish the postal revenue upon which
the British government relied to meet the outlay occasioned by
the contract with the Cunard company.</p>

<p>Labouchere, the colonial secretary, to whom the duke's views
were communicated, declined to submit them in their existing
shape to the colonial government. If the British government
had been in no way parties to the agreement made by the Canadian
government with Allan, the Canadian government were equally
unconsulted when the British government entered into the contract
with the Cunard company; and Labouchere pointed out that the
British government were without the means of enforcing its views
on the Canadian government.</p>

<p>If the postmaster general or the treasury, which coincided in
his views, were of a different opinion, Labouchere desired to know
what steps they proposed to take in the highly probable case that
the province declined the responsibility it was sought to impose
upon it. On the whole, the colonial secretary thought the preferable
course would be to allow the present arrangements to subsist
until the Cunard contract had expired, and then enter upon
negotiations with the Canadian government for sharing with it upon
equitable terms in the general expense of the transatlantic service.</p>

<p>The correspondence between the departments of government
in London&mdash;the tenor of which has been described&mdash;was submitted,
confidentially, to the governor general of Canada for his
opinion on the 17th of July, 1856. Sir Edmund Walker Head replied,
confidentially, to Labouchere, and set out Canada's position with
gratifying clearness. A Canadian, he observed, looked at the
circumstances from a point of view rather different from that in
which they had presented themselves to the postmaster general
at St. Martins-le-Grand. The Canadian asked: "Why are we
Canadians obliged to pay a subsidy at all for a line of steamers
running into the St. Lawrence to a British port, by a route which
we hold to be the most advantageous route? The merits of the
route itself might make our bounty unnecessary, were it not that
Her Majesty's government gives a large bounty to a line running
into foreign ports."</p>

<p>"It might be admitted," continued the governor general,
"that Canada was benefited by the rapid transmission of mails
through the United States; but she was no party to an arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
as one that could never be revoked. Canada, then, thought
that she could arrange for the conveyance of her own mails to
and fro by way of Quebec in summer and Portland in winter,
more rapidly and advantageously than by Boston and New York.
Why should Her Majesty's government discourage this new enterprise
on behalf of Her Majesty's subjects and by a large subsidy
drive the business to the United States ports?</p>

<p>"Canadians entertained the hope," the governor general further
observed, "that no course would be pursued by the British government
adverse to the principles of free trade, by the continuance
of a large bounty to the Boston and New York lines. Leave the
natural resources of the Canadian route to find their own level,
and in the meantime do not use all the influence of the British
post office so as to bear as hardly as possible on the first effort of
the colony to open the St. Lawrence to a regular line of British
steamers."</p>

<p>Head disclaimed the idea of giving these arguments as his own,
but stated that, they expressed the opinion of many Canadians,
among whom were some of the members of his council. In December,
Labouchere informed the governor general that his view had
prevailed, and that it was decided to leave the matter as it stood,
until the Cunard contract expired, when it was hoped that an
arrangement might be made more in conformity with what was
regarded as an equitable consideration for the finances of the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>The lack of cordiality displayed by the government of the
mother country towards the ocean transport enterprise of her colony
in its initial stages yielded to no warmer feeling with the progress
of the scheme. The Allan service was performed during
1856 and 1857, as the postmaster general stated, with meritorious
punctuality.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>In the beginning of 1858 the Quebec-Portland service attracted
the attention of the British post office, which intimated a desire
to utilize it for the conveyance of mails between Great Britain
and the United States during the period of the year when the Allan
steamers made Portland their port of arrival and departure.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Sidney Smith, the postmaster general of Canada, was of the
opinion that the Canadian line would be found the preferable one
during all seasons, particularly for those parts of the United States
bordering on the Great Lakes, as they were brought into direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
connection with the ocean at Quebec by means of the Grand Trunk
railway.</p>

<p>As an additional attraction to use the Canadian line, Smith
offered to reduce the charge for sea postage, that is, the portion
of the total postage between Great Britain and North America,
which was allocated to the ocean conveyance, from eightpence
to fourpence a letter. This would enable the public on both sides
of the Atlantic to send their letters for eightpence instead of twelvepence.</p>

<p>On consideration of this proposition by the governments of
Great Britain and the United States, it was found open to the
objection that the postage of letters carried by the Cunard line
must remain at one shilling, owing to the sea postage claimed by
the British government on letters carried by that line. Until
arrangements could be made between the British government
and that of the United States by which the charge on letters passing
between the two countries by the Cunard line could be reduced
from one shilling to eightpence, it was deemed inadmissible to
accept the Canadian proposition.</p>

<p>That seemed a reasonable decision, and it would have been
supposed that until the Canadian proposition could be accepted
the amount of sea postage paid for the Cunard service would be
applied to the Canadian service.</p>

<p>The British post office took no such view. It maintained that
the Canadian post office was entitled to no more than the rate
which it offered to accept, viz., fourpence, and as this rate added
to the land postage in Great Britain and the United States, would
only call for an eightpenny postage, it proposed that the difference
between the eightpence and the shilling, which the public were
actually charged, should be divided equally between the post
offices of Great Britain, the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>Smith protested that his proposition was part of the scheme
to reduce the postage from a shilling to eightpence sea postage,
and that until the reduction of the postage between Canada and
Great Britain to eightpence was affected, the Canadian government
were entitled to eightpence sea postage as much as the British
government were for the letters carried by the Cunards.</p>

<p>Alexander Tulloch Galt, inspector general of Canada, who was
in London at the time, laid the whole case before the colonial
secretary, pointing out that the attitude of Great Britain, in
attempting to make the United States a party to the scheme to
force Canada to take one-half the amount for sea postage that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
claimed by and conceded to the United States and Great Britain
in respect to their subsidized lines, was the more objectionable, as
there was no reason for believing that the United States had attached
any such stipulation to their consent to use the Canadian line.</p>

<p>Galt's remonstrance had the effect of inducing the British
government to withdraw from its untenable position in this
instance. In the course of his communication Galt mentioned
the disappointment with which it was learned in Canada that the
Cunard contract, which would not have expired until January,
1862, had been renewed in June 1858.</p>

<p>This action on the part of the British government, Galt insisted,
did not seem consistent with the assurance given by the colonial
secretary to the governor general in December 1856, when he
wrote that the lords of the treasury had apprised him "that the
existing arrangements with respect to the Canadian mail service
will continue until the expiration of the Cunard contract, when they
hope arrangements may be affected more in conformity with what
they would regard as an equitable consideration for the finances
of this country."</p>

<p>The Canadian legislature on the first opportunity, voted an
address to the queen, expostulating strongly against the course
of proceedings so injurious to the interests of Canada.</p>

<p>The action of the British government in prolonging the arrangements
with the Cunards was set in a strong light by a review of
several circumstances connected with it.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The application of the
Cunard company, for an extension of their contract, was made in
October 1857, only nine months after the discussion with the
Canadian government. It was referred by the treasury to the
admiralty and to the postmaster general.</p>

<p>The treasury recommended that it be granted, while the postmaster
general deprecated an extension, for reasons not connected
with the Canadian representations. On March 2, the treasury
decided that it was premature to discuss either an extension or a
renewal of the contract, though they expressed their readiness
to consider favourably, any application that Cunard might make
when the contract had advanced nearer to its termination.</p>

<p>On the 20th of the same month, Cunard made another application
on the same general grounds; and this time the treasury,
without further light on the subject, yielded, and directed the
extension, requesting the postmaster general to communicate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
views as to any modifications that might be introduced into the
contract, without materially affecting the basis of the existing
agreement.</p>

<p>The postmaster general, in reply, pointed out that the rate of
payment made to Cunard was considerably higher than that for
any other packet service, also that he had before him another offer
for the conveyance of the transatlantic mails for an amount much
less than was paid to Cunard. The new offer was from Inman,
agent for the Liverpool, New York and Philadelphia line, whose
vessels made their voyages at a speed not much inferior to Cunard's,
and who agreed to convey the mails for the amount of the sea
postage.</p>

<p>The offer had been received on the 1st of March, nineteen days
before the application of Cunard; and as the postmaster general
had had occasion to correspond with the postmaster general of
the United States respecting Inman's offer, he had not thought it
necessary to communicate this proposal to the treasury, nor did
the treasury consider that their duty required them to make any
further investigation before awarding the contract for £173,340
a year.</p>

<p>These facts are taken from the report of a select committee
appointed by the house of commons in 1860, to inquire into the
manner in which contracts have been made for the conveyance of
mails by sea. The committee found that, in the making of these
contracts, there was an extraordinary division of duty and consequent
responsibility, between several departments of government.</p>

<p>The parties by whom these contracts were actually entered into,
were the lords of the admiralty, but the authority for making them
rested with the treasury, who prescribed their terms and conditions.
The treasury before coming to the decisions which they communicated
to the admiralty, consulted with the postmaster general,
the colonial secretary, and with the admiralty themselves, in
reference to the postal, colonial and nautical questions involved.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the arrangements were scarcely open to criticism.
It was proper that the information necessary for a decision,
respecting, in the first place, whether a service was required at all,
and, in the next place, what the terms and conditions should be,
on which the service should be performed, should be concentrated
somewhere, and there seemed no place more fitting as a focal point
than the lords of the treasury, who were responsible for obtaining
and spending the money required for the maintenance of all the
services called for by the government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>But the fault lay not in the organization. It was to be found
in the lack of co-ordination among the contributory departments.
Several instances are given of the results of the failure of the
departments to co-operate with one another. One which has a
certain piquancy is the provision for the mail service to
Australia.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the first jarring note in the relations
between Great Britain and Canada concerning mail services arose
when Canada declined to fall in with the proposition that the
British government should arrange for the conveyance of the mails
across the Atlantic, and that Canada should pay its share of the
resulting outlay.</p>

<p>The colonial secretary submitted, as the model arrangement,
one which had been made between the governments of Great
Britain and the Australian colonies, under which each government
should pay half the cost of the service. The contract was to be
arranged for entirely by Great Britain, and the colonies were assured
that such care should be exercised in the arrangements that they
could depend on their interests being safeguarded.</p>

<p>How the government acquitted itself of the trust it assumed on
the behalf of Australia, the parliamentary report shall relate.
"That contract involved a yearly subsidy of £185,000, of which
one-half was to be paid by the Australian colonies, who had no
opportunities of being consulted in the framing of the contract;
so that special circumspection was required. The tender accepted
was that of a new company without experience, and who had no
ships fit for the work.</p>

<p>"One of their vessels," continues the report of the committee,
"the 'Oneida' which was reported against, by the professional
officer of the admiralty, and had not the horse power or tonnage
required by the contract, broke down on her first voyage. Time
was not kept, and though the colonies complained, it appears
that no steps were taken to ensure the fulfilment of the contract
with suitable vessels."</p>

<p>"The company," added the report of 1860, "in one year lost
their capital, £400,000; the service proved a complete failure, and
great risk of an interruption in postal communication was incurred.
This contract had been entirely arranged by the then financial
secretary, whose acts in these matters do not appear to have
received confirmation by any other authority."</p>

<p>It is not perhaps surprising, with the Australian venture in
mind, that an explanation involving the same sort of incompetence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
on the part of the departments of government should be made
regarding the Cunard contract.</p>

<p>The explanation of the Cunard contract was that when the
decision of the treasury granting the renewal was made, the then
financial secretary, who had only entered office with the change
of ministry in the month of March immediately preceding, was not
aware of the existence of the correspondence between the home
government and that of Canada in 1856; nor, though that correspondence
was among the records of the treasury, and the authority
on which the colonial secretary had written his despatch of December
3, 1856, was a minute of the treasury, did the proceedings
appear to have been known to any of the officers of the department
charged with this branch of the business.</p>

<p>The committee observed that they had not received any satisfactory
explanation of the circumstance that a matter so recent,
and of such importance, should have been lost sight of.</p>

<p>But the painful story of the relations between the government
of the mother country and that of her North American colony with
respect to the ocean transport enterprise set on foot by Canada,
does not end here. In the autumn of 1858, an Irish company
known as the Lever or Galway Company, which had a contract
with the Newfoundland government for a mail service between
Galway and St. Johns, proposed to the British government to
establish a service with fortnightly frequency between Galway and
America.</p>

<p>This scheme excited considerable interest, particularly in
Ireland; and several representations were made to the government,
by deputations and by memorials from chambers of commerce,
setting forth their sense of the advantages which it would confer
on the trade of that country. The publicity given this project
brought into the field the two applicants who had been disappointed
when the Cunard contract had been extended in 1857.</p>

<p>Inman on October 15 protested against the granting of a subsidy
to a new line, and expressed the hope that, if it should be
decided to give assistance to a line from Galway, the proposed
service should be put up to public competition. The treasury
replied to Inman, informing him that when a new service was about
to be established by the government it was their practice to invite
tenders by public advertisement, thereby affording to all parties
the opportunity of tendering therefor. Inman heard no more
from the government on the subject before the contract with
Lever was concluded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>The Canadian government, also, advanced its claims for consideration.
Galt wrote to the colonial secretary on November 11,
1858, and the London agent of the Canadian line on January 18,
1859, submitted an application to the treasury. He pointed out
that the effects of this subsidized line would be disastrous to the
prospects of his company, and expressed the trust of his principals
"that before interfering to crush a provincial company of such
magnitude, your lordships will at least afford the company we
represent an opportunity of being heard."</p>

<p>This appeal was so far successful, that it obtained for the
company the honour of an interview at the treasury. They were
promised that their representations would be considered; but no
further notice was taken of their application.</p>

<p>On the same day on which the Canadian company's letter was
dated, viz., January 18, the Lever company submitted an offer
for the conveyance of the mails from Galway to Portland, Boston
and New York, calling at Newfoundland for £3000 a voyage. The
treasury, following the practice laid down for their guidance, asked
the postmaster general for his opinion on the proposal.</p>

<p>The postmaster general reported adversely, observing that it
was not expedient to enter into any contract for the service, which
would bind the government to a heavy annual payment. He was
also of the opinion that the vast mercantile traffic between the two
countries afforded abundant opportunities to secure additional
service that might be desired on favourable terms.</p>

<p>Here then were three strong reasons to call for the government
staying their hands from entering into a contract with Lever:
the remonstrance of Inman, coupled with the intimation from the
treasury that in the event of their deciding to establish the service,
they would put it to public tender; the expostulation of Galt on
November 11, 1858, and the appeal of the Canadian company
for an opportunity to be heard on January 18; and the unfavourable
report of the selected adviser of the treasury.</p>

<p>Yet, in the face of all these circumstances, the treasury on
February 22, authorized a contract to be made for a fortnightly
service to Galway and New York, and Galway and Boston, alternately,
at the rate of £3000 a voyage. The parliamentary committee
in seeking an explanation for this extraordinary course,
examined Lord Derby, the chancellor of the exchequer, as to the
reasons which moved him to authorize this service.</p>

<p>Derby stated that he was influenced mainly by the consideration
of the social and commercial advantages which this service would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
confer on Ireland, and of the preference due to the Lever Company
on account of its enterprize, in first establishing a line of steamers
from Galway.</p>

<p>Derby stated, however, that when he authorized the service
he had not before him some materials, nor had he in view some
considerations, which, the committee believed, should have been
held essential elements in the determination of the question. He
had no knowledge of the correspondence which had passed between
the home government and that of Canada, and between the treasury
and Inman.</p>

<p>Consequently then, in the words of the committee of the house
of commons, Derby's decision was given "in ignorance of the
strong feeling in Canada as to the injury done to their interests by
the system of subsidizing what they deemed rival lines; of the
assurance given in 1856, on which the Canadian government relied,
as a pledge that they would have an opportunity of being heard
before that system was renewed or extended; and of the surprise
and dissatisfaction already occasioned by the renewal, without
hearing them, of the Cunard contract; and in ignorance, also, of
the implied pledge given to Mr. Inman, that the new service would
be thrown open to public competition.</p>

<p>"It was likewise given," the committee added, "without any consideration
of the question, whether, assuming the interests of
Ireland warranted the establishment of the service from Galway,
that object might not have been secured by an arrangement which
would, at the same time, have provided for the wants, and satisfied
the just claims of Canada."</p>

<p>The round condemnation by a committee of the house of commons,
of the course pursued by the government, gave Smith, the
postmaster general of Canada, a handle of which he was not slow
to make full use. The report of the committee was laid before the
house of commons on May 22, and on the 30th of the same
month, Smith again approached the government on the subject,
setting forth the grounds of his appeal to the British government,
and concluding by asking that the government should aid the
Canadian line by a subsidy of £50,000 a year. He pledged the
Canadian government to give a like amount for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The application was refused, and Smith, whose resources seemed
endless, approached the subject from another angle.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The contract
which was made with the Lever Company called for a fortnightly
service, the consideration being £3000 a trip, or £78,000 a year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
The Lever Company was in no position to fulfil the terms of its
contract, and Smith opened negotiations with the company to take
over their contract, stipulating to allow the company £35,000 of
the £78,000 which the contract would bring, as the consideration
for the assignment.</p>

<p>An agreement was concluded on these terms, and the deeds were
signed on July 6, 1860. The only condition now was the consent
of the British government to the arrangement, which was required
by the contract, but which under the circumstances was regarded
as purely formal. The terms being laid before the secretary of the
treasury and the postmaster general, secured the approval of both
those authorities; and on the 11th of July, the sailing arrangements
under the contract were settled between Smith and the official in
charge of the post office packet service. Success seemed now
assured, but before the day was over, the situation had undergone
an entire change, for the British government had refused its assent
to the assignment of the contract.</p>

<p>No reason was given for the refusal of the British government
to sanction the transfer of the Lever contract to the Canadian
line. Smith wrote to the secretary of the treasury for an explanation.
He pointed out that the negotiations were made with the
assent of Lord Palmerston and the treasury, that the arrangements
had all been made on the secretary's assurance, and that in view
of the strong feeling already existing in Canada on account of
the treatment meted out to Canada in regard to its ocean mail
service, he would be wanting in respect to the imperial authorities
if he accepted the secretary's intimation literally, and in its full
significance.</p>

<p>The secretary in his reply, gave away the whole case of the government.
He admitted that for himself he had never concealed his
opinion that the arrangement proposed by the Canadian government
would have been a desirable one, but insisted that he had not used
Palmerston's name beyond that. He had ascertained Palmerston's
views as to the importance of meeting the wishes of Canada,
sufficiently to warrant him, not in concluding negotiations, but in
advancing them to the point where a definite proposal might be
made to the government.</p>

<p>The ground on which the treasury based refusal of assent to
the agreement made between the Lever Company and the Canadian
government, was that the contract contemplated the grant of
£78,000 a year for a fortnightly service from Galway, in addition to
the other ocean services which were then in operation, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
transfer of the Lever contract to the Allan's would have the effect
of merely substituting one contract for another, leaving the service
just where it stood before&mdash;with an additional charge of £78,000
a year against the government.</p>

<p>There was another consideration and an extraordinary one.
The government had suffered severe condemnation at the hands of
the committee of the house of commons for their disregard of the
pledge given, that, before a contract was awarded it would be put
up for public competition. Their action in awarding the contract
to the Lever Company without tender was an undeniable injury
to the interests of Canada, and now this censure was made the cover
for another blow at those same interests.</p>

<p>The secretary of the treasury observed that the pledge formerly
given and unfortunately overlooked had acquired much notoriety
and must in any contingency afterwards arising be treated with
rigour. "If the Galway contract be considered binding," he
concluded, "the government cannot be accused of breaking this
pledge as long as they simply continue to pay the subsidy for the
same services and to the same parties." But the case became
different if they sanctioned a new arrangement involving material
modifications, particularly when the arrangement transferred the
contract to a party of undoubted, from one of questioned, solvency.</p>

<p>Smith next addressed Palmerston, and his letter shows clearly
the incomprehensible and provoking course pursued by that statesman.
At every step in the negotiations the treasury was consulted,
and its approval gained. The solicitor of the Galway Company
was also in frequent communication with the treasury, and he
actually altered the form of the deed of transfer upon the suggestion
of the secretary.</p>

<p>The resolution of the Galway Company, accepting the proposal
of the Canadian government, was adopted, and on the same day
the treasury was informed of the fact. A week later&mdash;on July
5, 1860&mdash;Smith and Galt, the Canadian minister of finance,
waited on the secretary of the treasury, who informed them that
Palmerston was much gratified that the arrangements had been
made, and on the strength of these assurances Smith executed the
assignment of the contract, and provided securities for the purchase
money, of all of which Palmerston expressed his high approval.</p>

<p>The matter was regarded as so far concluded that on July 9
a meeting took place between the Canadian representatives and the
officials of the treasury and post office, the details of the scheme
were reduced to writing, and the secretary of the post office received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the approval of a communication to the postmaster general of the
United States informing him of the arrangement, and that thereafter
the Canadian ships would be considered as British and not as
United States packets.</p>

<p>Considering the arrangements as completed, Smith and Galt
decided to return to Canada, and on the 11th they called on Palmerston
for the purpose of taking their leave, when, to their utter
stupefaction, they were informed that the government peremptorily
refused to sanction the transfer.</p>

<p>The reasons put forward for this unusual action on the part
of the government lacked even the merit of plausibility. It was
first argued that the Lever contract contemplated the grant of
£78,000 a year for a fortnightly service from Galway, in addition to
all the ocean service which might be existing, while the transfer
would have the effect of substituting the Galway service for one of
the existing services, and thus continuing the charge of £78,000 a
year with a positive diminution of public accommodation.</p>

<p>Smith had a conclusive reply to this argument. He pointed
out that at the time the Galway contract was entered into, that is
on May 21, 1859, the Canadian service was only fortnightly; and
the arrangement for which the sanction of the government was
sought would have given exactly the accommodation contemplated
when the contract was given&mdash;a weekly service between Ireland
and America.</p>

<p>As for the modifications in the contract, which formed part
of the ground of the government's refusal to sanction it, the first
was that "the arrangement transferred the contract to a party of
undoubted, from one of questioned, solvency." Smith's only
comment on this was to complete the sentence by adding "or in
other words would ensure its performance efficiently."</p>

<p>The only other important modification sought by Canada in the
terms of the contract was the substitution of Canadian for United
States terminal ports in America. Apart from the slight to Canadian
interests involved in putting forward such a reason, it must be clear
that the Cunard line, in which the British government did not
conceal its interest, would have been benefited and not injured
by the withdrawal of a line running to United States ports. Smith
concluded his protest by pointing out the distinction which the
Canadian people could not fail to draw in comparing Palmerston's
refusal, with that of previous governments.</p>

<p>The grants to the Cunard and Galway lines were stated to have
been made in ignorance of the Canadian interests, and the inability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of the government to remedy these and other evils was deplored.
In the case under consideration the British government, Smith
pointed out, deliberately opposed themselves to that which would
have benefited Canada, and had determined that the competition
of which they complained should be maintained. The protest
was quite without avail. The Galway Company entered on the
performance of its contract, but its service was marked with so
much irregularity, that the postmaster general was compelled to
cancel it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Canadian ocean mail service (<i>cont.</i>)&mdash;Series of disasters to Allan line steamers.</p></div>


<p>The year 1859 was a notable one in the history of transportation in
Canada. In May, the steamers of the Allan line commenced
their weekly trips between Liverpool and Quebec. In November,
the completion of the Victoria Bridge over the St. Lawrence carried
the lines of the eastern division of the Grand Trunk into Montreal,
thus connecting by uninterrupted railway communication the cities
of Quebec and Portland with the metropolis, and establishing
a continuous line of railway from the Atlantic seaboard to the
western boundary of the provinces. In the same month, also, the
Grand Trunk extended its line across the border as far as Detroit,
bringing, by means of allied systems in the United States, the
cities of Chicago and New Orleans into communication with the
eastern states and with Europe by the railway system along the
shores of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The system of land transportation between the ports of the
Atlantic and the cities on the Mississippi being thus perfected,
and available for the conveyance of mails between Europe and the
heart of North America by practically continuous conveyance,
the postmaster general of Canada, Sidney Smith, proceeded to
Europe to improve, as far as possible, the communication between
the important cities of Great Britain and the sailing ports of the
Canadian vessels, and to arrange for the exploitation of this
transportation system, in the interests of Canada.</p>

<p>Before leaving for England Smith paid a visit to Washington,
and laid before the postmaster general there the advantages offered
by the system under his control. He pointed out that, by the
Grand Trunk railway, the journey between Portland and Chicago
was made in forty-nine hours, and between Quebec and Chicago
in forty-five hours, and, by making Cork a port of call for the
mails, the voyage between land and land would be several hundred
miles shorter than by any other route.</p>

<p>Smith's proposition was to convey the United States mails
to and from Europe for the sea postage only, and to allow these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
mails to be carried across Canada without charge on the understanding
that the Canadian mails to and from Great Britain should
be carried free across the United States territory during the period
of winter when the steamers called at Portland. The proposition
was accepted by the postmaster general of the United States.</p>

<p>In London, where he arrived at the end of November, Smith
submitted his scheme to the postmaster general,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> who made the
objection that the sailing arrangements interfered with the plans
made for the other transatlantic mail steamers. Fortunately
Smith had the support of the postmaster general at Washington,
who was much impressed with the merits of the Canadian scheme,
and who, in his annual report expressed the opinion that it would
afford the most direct and probably the most expeditious communication
between Chicago and Liverpool.</p>

<p>At the instance of the department at Washington, the general
post office agreed to send by the Canadian steamers the correspondence
for both the eastern and western States, and also agreed
to Smith's request for special trains for the mail service from
London to Cork. This special railway service, with its connecting
mail boat service across the Irish Channel gave the British public a
full business day more to prepare their correspondence for the
States.</p>

<p>The mails had, in ordinary course, to be prepared in London
early Wednesday morning to catch the outgoing steamer which
left Liverpool the same evening, but the special train from Dublin
to Cork enabled correspondents to hold over their urgent letters
until Wednesday evening and send them by the evening mail to
Ireland, where connection was made on Thursday morning with the
steamer which had left Liverpool on the previous evening.</p>

<p>But this was not the only, or perhaps the greatest, of the advantages
of the scheme. Transatlantic cables were still in the future,
but the telegraphic systems on both sides of the Atlantic were
fully developed, and messages for New York or Montreal could be
addressed to the steamer, which would deliver them at Father
Point, on its way up the St. Lawrence, from there they were sent
by telegraph to their destination.</p>

<p>One of the leading London papers declared that the plan would
save two full days for telegrams, and permit transactions on the
stock exchange in London up to Thursday afternoon to be communicated
to the stock exchanges in the United States on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Saturday of the following week, and the action taken in these
centres transmitted to London by the Canadian steamers leaving
Quebec the same day.</p>

<p>Having completed these arrangements in London, Smith next
addressed himself to the postal administrations of France, Belgium
and Prussia. In the month that had elapsed since the negotiations
with London had been concluded, the steamers had crossed the
Atlantic both ways, and the Canadian postmaster general was
able to inform the continental administrations that on the first
voyage the mails from Chicago had reached London in twelve
days, and that the conveyance from New Orleans, in which France
had a special interest, ought to be effected in less than fifteen days.</p>

<p>The French government, to whom Smith offered the same
terms for conveyance by steamer and railway in Canada as had
been accepted in the United States, immediately closed with Smith
on these terms, subject to the consent of Great Britain. In a few
days Belgium took similar action, while Prussia deferred acceptance
until the postmaster general of Canada could confer with the
United States.</p>

<p>Entirely satisfied with the success of his mission to the Continent,
Smith returned to London to conclude the transaction by obtaining
the permission of the British post office to act as intermediary
for the payments which would be made by the French and other
Continental governments to Canada for the conveyance of their
mails to America.</p>

<p>The necessity for having Great Britain as the intermediary
for the settlement of these accounts arose from the following
considerations. Great Britain had open accounts with all these
countries. The mails from these countries were carried to the
United States by British steamers, for which they became indebted
to the British government; while on the other hand mails from
Great Britain for the countries of eastern Europe and for India,
passed over one or other of these countries through their postal
systems, which gave rise to an indebtedness on the part of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Under conventions with each of them, settlements were made
from time to time. None of this accounting machinery existed
between Canada and any of these countries. The only country in
Europe with which Canada had an open account was Great Britain.</p>

<p>In consequence of Canada's isolation in this respect the only
way these countries could settle their debts to Canada was by
direct payments. This, however, would involve legislation, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
least in the case of France, which would have delayed the beginning
of the plans for many months. Canada, therefore, had but one
way open, which was to ask the British post office to receive from
France the amounts due by that country to Canada, and apply
these sums to the account between Great Britain and Canada.</p>

<p>The favour to Canada appeared slight enough but the British
post office refused to grant it. First, it objected that the arrangements
would involve a great deal of trouble; and afterwards,
when driven from that ground, it took an extraordinary position.
The British post office declared that the British mails exchanged
with the United States were treated in that office as mails carried
by packets under contract with the United States, and that it
would be inconvenient and objectionable to treat French mails,
carried by the same Canadian vessels, as mails conveyed by
British packets.</p>

<p>It maintained, furthermore, that the postmaster general of the
United States, having entered into an agreement with the Canadian
post office for the transmission of United States mails by the
Canadian vessels, might very naturally object to any arrangement
between the British and French post offices under which the
French mails were paid for as mails conveyed by Great Britain's
packets.</p>

<p>The pettifogging of disobliging illwill could go no further. In
no single respect did the service rendered to the United States
by the British government, in conveying the mails of that country
to Great Britain, differ from the services rendered to the United
States by the Canadian government in the conveyance of the
United States mails to Great Britain by the steamers of the
Canadian line. Both were paid by the United States for the
service, and the fact that the British took pay from the United
States no more rendered the Cunard an American line, than a
similar fact regarding the Canadian government made the Canadian
an American line.</p>

<p>Smith, in dwelling upon this point, affected to discover that the
ground of the British official objection, was that the Cunard
Company received a subsidy from the British government, while
the Canadian Company did not. If this were indeed the difficulty
at which the British office stumbled, and the Canadian line could
be made British by granting a subsidy for its maintenance, it was
important that it should have impressed upon it this distinctive
mark of British nationality.</p>

<p>But these arguments fell upon deaf ears. The French office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
tried to make the British officials see reason, but their success
was no better. The situation became one of real difficulty. The
French could have invoked the assistance of the United States and
asked that country to act as intermediary in the settlement of the
account between France and Canada, but there would have been
much delay, as the United States would almost certainly seek an
explanation of the attitude of Great Britain toward her colony, and
that would not have been easy to give.</p>

<p>The British post office, however, suggested a way out of the
difficulty. Taking its stand on the ground that the Canadian
steamers were part of the United States packet service, the British
post office held that the proper course for France was to arrange
the matter of payment with the United States post office. But
as the negotiations between the United States and France might
delay the start of the service, the British expressed its willingness
as a temporary measure to take from the French government the
sums due to Canada, and pay them over to whom? To the
Canadian government to whom alone they belonged? Not at all.
It would pay these sums to the postmaster general of the United
States.</p>

<p>Smith, the postmaster general of Canada, contended no further.
He thanked the postmaster general of England for his consideration,
and addressed himself to the director of the French posts,
and to the postmaster general in Washington. But the director
was completely puzzled, and sought an explanation of the British
post office. Disclaiming the right to interfere in any agreement
between the British and Canadian offices, he declared himself
unable to understand why this payment should be made to the
United States, or how it could possibly happen that the United
States should have any right to claim any sea rate. He set out all
the facts of the case, and after looking them over carefully, he
repeated that he did not understand why the amount paid by the
French government to the British office for conveyance under the
British flag by Canadian packets should be paid over to the United
States office.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>By the middle of February 1860, Smith was back in the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
States, and at Washington. Within a day he concluded arrangements
by which, among the other matters, the United States post
office agreed to accept the sums due to Canada by France and the
other Continental countries. Provision was also made for the
exceptional handling of correspondence for New Orleans and other
southern cities by the officials of the Canadian service.</p>

<p>The matter of accounting having been arranged on this basis
the Canadian line began to be employed extensively on both sides
of the Atlantic. Two changes were made in 1860, which augmented
its efficiency. As it was found that Cork was out of the way of
steamers from Quebec to Liverpool, in May, Londonderry, at the
north of Ireland was substituted as the last port of call.</p>

<p>This change had the additional advantage that it enabled the
steamers to take a later mail from Scotland, and it avoided the
rivalry with the Cunard and Inman lines, which made Cork their
port of call in Ireland.</p>

<p>The other amelioration in this arrangement was the taking
on and the disembarkation of mails at Riviere du Loup, a point
on the St. Lawrence one hundred and twenty miles below Quebec.
The extension of the Grand Trunk railway to this point shortened
the sea-voyage by some hours, as the stretch of water between
Quebec and Riviere du Loup present difficulties, and not infrequently
dangers, which prevent rapid travel.</p>

<p>With the arrangements thus complete, the St. Lawrence route
was much superior to any other as far as the Canadian mails were
concerned. In 1863, four-fifths of the mail carried between Canada
and Britain were carried by the Canadian steamers, the remainder
being taken by the Cunards. In order to participate in the
exchange between Great Britain and the United States, it was
necessary to make its arrangements conform with the arrangements
made by those countries.</p>

<p>Under this scheme, the week was divided into two parts, Great
Britain providing for the total conveyance for one of the parts
and the United States the other. Thus the United States took
upon itself the accumulated mails for the first three days of the
week from England, and the Cunard steamers, which left England
on Saturday, took those of the last part.</p>

<p>There was an American steamer which sailed from Southampton
on Wednesday, which took all the mails for the United States
that could be gathered at that point until the time of its departure,
and the Canadian steamer, which was adopted by the American
post office, took those which could be gathered at Liverpool for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the sailing from that point on Thursday and at Londonderry on
the following day.</p>

<p>The Canadian steamers offered great advantages to northern
England and to Ireland and Scotland. In the conveyance from
this side of the Atlantic, the arrangements were reversed, the
British steamers sailing from New York on Wednesday, and the
American later in the week. The Allan Company were fortunate
in securing Saturday as their sailing day from Quebec, as their
steamers were able to take a large American mail as well as nearly
all that from Canadian offices.</p>

<p>Most of the foreign correspondence of Michigan, Wisconsin,
Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Indiana were carried by the Canadian
route, while, during the winter months, half the mail from New
England and a large volume from New York were despatched by
this line. By the arrangements with the post offices of France,
Belgium and Prussia, a considerable quantity of mails were
exchanged by this line between the United States and nearly every
country in Europe.</p>

<p>The achievement of the Canadian steamship line, in the face
of unusual difficulties, was a matter of pride to the people of
Canada, and the postmaster general, who had exhibited noteworthy
energy in exploiting the possibilities of the service, dwelt with
much satisfaction, in his several reports to the legislature, on
the measure of success attained in competition with the lines
running to the ports of the United States.</p>

<p>But these successes were bought at a heavy price. In the
weekly race across the Atlantic, much was sacrificed to speed.
Risks were taken which, with the imperfect knowledge then
existing of the sailing route, could lead to but one result. Vessel
after vessel was lost under circumstances that excited a growing
horror and resentment among all classes of the people. During
the seven years between June 1, 1857, and February 22, 1864, no
less than eight of the finest vessels in the service went down,
carrying with them many hundreds of human beings.</p>

<p>The first mishap took place within six months of the commencement
of the service by the Allan line. In November 1856, the
"Canadian," in her course up the St. Lawrence, ran ashore, owing
to either the negligence or the ignorance of the pilot. She was got
off without injury. But the "Canadian" was less fortunate in
June 1857, when, from the same cause, she again ran ashore.
This time it was impossible to free her, and she had to be abandoned,
a total loss. The year 1858 passed without trouble of any kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and as the voyages were increased from fortnightly to weekly,
confidence was high that the superiority of the Canadian line was
to be demonstrated, and the supremacy of the Atlantic wrested
from the Cunards.</p>

<p>But with the inauguration of the weekly service, and of the
declared competition with the steamers sailing in and out of New
York, a series of disasters commenced, which threw a shadow
over the whole enterprise. In the five years following the establishment
of weekly service, the Canadian line lost more first class
vessels than all the other companies engaged in transatlantic conveyance,
and during the same period, as if to remove any doubt
as to the locality to which these disasters were attributed, every
vessel lost went down on this side of the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>In the winter of 1859, two of the finest vessels of the line were
lost, and with them a great number of lives. The winter route of
the Allan steamers between Liverpool and Portland ran westward
from Ireland to Cape Race, the south-eastern extremity of Newfoundland,
thence to the waters between Sable Island and Nova
Scotia, the coast of which the steamers skirted for its whole length.
After getting clear of Cape Sable, the southerly point of Nova
Scotia, vessels had a deep water passage for the rest of the voyage.</p>

<p>The Nova Scotia coast was a source of much anxiety to navigators.
The "Columbia," the only vessel of the Cunard line
which was lost until this time, was wrecked on this coast, as were
also the "Humboldt" of the American line and the "City
of Manchester" of the Inman line. It was on this coast also that
the two Allan ships were wrecked. On the 29th of November,
the "Indian," on her way out from Liverpool, ran ashore on the
"Deal Ledges" near the fishing hamlet of Marie Joseph. Parting
amidships, some sixty of her passengers were lost. It was made
clear that the captain had taken every precaution after leaving
Cape Race, but he had been misled by defective charts.</p>

<p>Three months later, on the 20th of February, 1860, the
"Hungarian" went down among the rocks off Cape Sable, and not
a soul on board was saved. This steamer was the pride of the fleet.
She was a new vessel, and had a record of three consecutive
passages in twenty-seven days and twenty-three hours. The facts
disclosed by the investigation were few. But it did transpire that
the captain was noted for a certain dash rather than for seamanly
prudence. It was said that by his skill in shaving sharp corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
and scudding over shoals, and by his recklessness in keeping up
a head of steam, he had converted the slowest of the Canadian
steamers into the fastest.</p>

<p>News of the disaster to the "Hungarian" soon reached
Montreal. It was melancholy news for the city, and public grief
was soon followed by popular anger with the Allan Company and
with the postmaster general. Smith was denounced by the legislature
as <i>particeps criminis</i> in the destruction of the lives which
had been lost on the "Hungarian."</p>

<p>A parliamentary investigation was ordered into the circumstances,
and the report<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> of the committee is instructive in the
information it gives on the coast lights, and on the problems,
which the substitution of iron for wood in the construction of
steam vessels raised for those dealing with questions of navigation.</p>

<p>Neither Sable Island nor Cape Sable, on the winter route, were
provided with lighthouses; and the lower St. Lawrence was most
inadequately furnished with the indispensable guides for sailing
by night. From Forteau Bay on the straits of Belle Isle, a vessel
ran four hundred and fifty miles before it passed a lighthouse,
and it then entered a stretch of one hundred and twenty miles
which it was obliged to make without the assistance of lights.</p>

<p>On the comparative merits of iron and wooden vessels, expert
opinion was unanimous in favour of wooden vessels. It was
considered that, in the event of a vessel being wrecked or stranded,
there was less liability of loss of life in the wooden vessel. There
was also the effect of the material of which the vessels were built on
the working of the compass. In iron vessels, the compasses were
a source of great and continued anxiety.</p>

<p>Before the vessels proceeded to sea, the local attraction from
the ship was neutralized by magnets and, thus adjusted, the
compasses acted with tolerable accuracy while the vessel was at
sea and beyond the influence of land attraction. But when
approaching the land the compasses were not to be depended
upon. There was, it was asserted, an attraction from the land,
but whether the mass of iron in the vessel was first acted upon by
the land attraction, was a problem of which the existing state of
science did not afford a solution.</p>

<p>The Cunard line at this time&mdash;1860&mdash;consisted of ten vessels.
Only two were of iron; and it was noted that the irregular action
of the compass on the iron vessel "Persia," after it left Cape
Race, led the vessel into danger which was only averted by unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
care with the soundings. The committee of the legislature
concluded by expressing a fear that, until new light had been
thrown on the susceptibilities and workings of the mysterious
magnetic forces, it might be necessary to abandon the construction
of iron vessels.</p>

<p>Misfortune continued to dog the course of the Canadian
steamers. In 1861 two more vessels were lost&mdash;both on the
St. Lawrence route.</p>

<p>The "Canadian," the second of the name, launched in 1860,
set out from Quebec for Liverpool on the 1st of June. Reaching
the straits of Belle Isle two days later she encountered a heavy
gale and great masses of ice. About eight miles from Cape Bauld,
the northernmost point of Newfoundland, the vessel was struck by
a sunken floe, which tore a hole in her side under the water-line,
and she sank in two hours. Twenty-nine of the passengers and
crew were drowned, including James Panton, the mail officer, who
neglected the means of safety in his endeavours to save the mail.</p>

<p>The only criticism made by the board of trade court was that
the straits route being a perilous one except at the height of the
season, the sailing instructions which gave masters a discretion
of taking this route after the 20th of May ought to be amended
by fixing the earliest date at a month later.</p>

<p>At the end of the season&mdash;on the 5th of November&mdash;the "North
Briton" ran ashore in an attempt to make the passage between
the Island of Anticosti and the Mingan Islands. The circumstances
that the vessel entered the passage an hour after midnight, with
a heavy sea running, were noted by the marine court. But they
confined themselves to a censure on the captain for some lack of
vigilance, not considering it necessary to deprive him of his
certificate.</p>

<p>Again there was a burst of public indignation, and a demand
that the government should dissociate themselves from the contract.
The postmaster general pleaded that such action would, in the eyes
of the foreign governments, be tantamount to a confession that
Canadians had lost faith in their route. He assured the legislature
that he was bringing effective pressure on the Allan Company to
compel them to perform their contract satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The complete immunity from accident during 1862 seemed to
indicate that the measures forced upon the company by the postmaster
general were successful. But the faith of the Canadian in
the superior advantages of their route was soon to be put to further
trials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the 27th of April, 1863, and the 22nd of February,
1864&mdash;a scant ten months&mdash;three vessels of the line were lost.
The first of these, the "Anglo-Saxon," which crashed into the
rocky coast of Newfoundland, a few miles above Cape Race, gave
some point to the observations of the commission as to the disturbing
influences operating upon the compasses of vessels as they
approached land.</p>

<p>The "Anglo-Saxon" left Liverpool on the 16th of April, and for
the first nine days made an uneventful voyage. A clear, bright
day on the 26th gave the captain an opportunity to make observations,
and ascertain the ship's position; and as the weather was
steady, he was able to run under full steam and sail.</p>

<p>Next morning it was foggy; and John Young&mdash;a former
commissioner of public works, and one of the chief advocates
of the Canadian ocean service&mdash;asked the captain if it was his
intention to make Cape Race. The captain said it was not, as by
noon they would be twenty miles south of the Cape. About
eleven o'clock Young's attention was directed to what appeared
to be a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hugh'">huge</ins> iceberg close at hand. He ran towards the deck, but
before he could reach it the ship struck, and he found himself
facing a precipitous mass of rock so lofty that in the fog he could
not see the top of it.</p>

<p>Instead of being sixteen or seventeen miles south of Cape Race,
the vessel was four miles above it. Though they were so close to
land that many passengers saved themselves by creeping along
the mast to the shore, 238 passengers were drowned, including
the captain, whose faulty seamanship had brought about the
calamity.</p>

<p>This shore is the most dangerous on the north Atlantic.
Besides the magnetic influences, there is an underplay of powerful
currents, which makes navigation in these waters difficult and
dangerous. The Newfoundland government published a list in
1901 showing that seventy-seven vessels, great and small, had been
lost on the Cape or within a few miles to the north or west of it.</p>

<p>Not quite two months later than the disaster of April 27,
1863, while excitement in Canada was still running high, the public
were dumbfounded by the news of another disaster. The
"Norwegian," a vessel built only two years, left Liverpool on the
4th of June. On the 10th she entered a dense fog which continued
at short intervals until the 13th. At noon that day the fog lifted
and the steamer put on full steam. At two o'clock in the morning
land was sighted, which the captain took to be Newfoundland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship's course was altered in accordance with that view,
and although the fog fell densely, speed was not reduced. At
seven o'clock there was a cry of breakers, and before the steamer
could be checked or turned, she struck heavily upon the rocks of
St. Paul's Island, a point in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a few miles
north of Cape Breton. The ship's position was so dangerous that
the passengers were landed on the island. Afterwards the cargo
and mails were secured.</p>

<p>The public were bewildered by the accumulation of disasters.
The captain of the "Norwegian" was especially known as a
careful and skilful navigator, and there was a persistent and
vigorously expressed demand on the Allan Company for an explanation.
To their plea of the danger of the route, the answer
was that the "Hungarian," "Indian," and "Anglo-Saxon" were
wrecked on a route over which the Cunard steamers had been
passing in safety for years.</p>

<p>Iron vessels accordingly came in for condemnation. Except
two, all the Cunard steamers were of wood, and these iron vessels
were run only between Liverpool and New York, over a route
all the way on the broad ocean.</p>

<p>The wreck of the "African" of the Cunard line on the coast
of Newfoundland, which took place about this time, under circumstances
similar to those attending the loss of the "Anglo-Saxon,"
showed, it was claimed, the superiority of the wooden vessels,
when overtaken by accident. She was pierced in several places,
but was not smashed as an iron hull would have been. Consequently,
when the vessel got free of the rocks it was able to reach
St. Johns where it put in for repairs.</p>

<p>The remainder of the summer of 1863 passed without incident,
and a considerable part of the winter, when on the 22nd of
February, 1864, the "Bohemian" in her passage to Portland,
struck on Alden's Rock, close to her destination, and overturned,
sinking within an hour and a half. The passengers and crew
numbered 317 persons, and of these forty-three were drowned by
the capsizing of one of the lifeboats. The court of inquiry attributed
the catastrophe to the neglect of the captain to take the
ordinary precautions, when confronted with a perilous situation,
and he was deprived of his certificate for twelve months.</p>

<p>During the period between the wreck of the "Canadian" the
first, in 1857, and the sinking of the "Bohemian" in 1864, there
were thirteen vessels lost, of all lines engaged in the transatlantic
trade, and of these eight were of the Canadian line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>The Canadian government and the Allan Company were
subjected to a pitiless condemnation; and, with a change of
administration in 1863, the new government lost no time in taking
steps to end the contract.</p>

<p>Oliver Mowat, the new postmaster general, on the 12th of
August, 1863, presented a report to the executive council recounting
the attempts of the Canadian government to establish a Canadian
line of steamers from 1853, when the first contract was made with
the Liverpool firm of Mackeen, McLarty and Company. The
contract with this firm called for a fortnightly service in summer
and monthly in winter, with screw steamers of not less than 1200
tons, the subsidy from which was to be £24,000 a year.</p>

<p>In consequence of the default of the contractors, a new contract
was made with Hugh Allan. The frequency of the service, and the
amount of the subsidy remained unchanged, but Allan engaged
to employ vessels of 1750 tons, instead of 1200.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October, 1857, a new contract was entered into
with Allan for weekly service to commence on the 1st of May, 1859.
The size of the vessels required was again increased, and the new
steamers had to be built to 2000 tons. The subsidy was to be
£55,000. By 1860, three vessels had been lost, and Allan, having
found that the loss in carrying on the weekly service was far
beyond his calculations, notified the government of his intention
to terminate.</p>

<p>The government, believing that it was essential to hold public
confidence in the route, and that this could be best done by
enabling the contractor to provide larger and more powerful
vessels to replace those which had been lost, determined to offer
a much larger subsidy, and to stipulate for vessels of 2300 tons.
A new contract embodying these conditions was made, and the
compensation was fixed at £104,000.</p>

<p>In brief this was the situation when Mowat became postmaster
general, though there had been negotiations between Smith and the
Allan Company for a reduction of the subsidy. With the sanction
of the government, Mowat cancelled the contract on April 1, 1864,
and began negotiations for a new contract.</p>

<p>Mowat perceived that, unless there was to be a lapse in the
service on the 1st of April, he must make his arrangements with Allan,
since there was no other vessel owner in a position to take up the
service on the termination of the contract. Mowat was the less
reluctant to renew an engagement with Allan, as he recognized
the courage, energy and perseverance of the latter, and was convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that Allan's experience would give him a great advantage
over any other contractor.</p>

<p>The new contract contained provisions which were a confession
that the government had been far from blameless for the losses of
the several vessels of the Allan line. The mail steamers were
expressly forbidden to approach Cape Race when the weather was
so foggy or tempestuous as to make it dangerous to do so; when
the presence of fog or ice should render it perilous to run at full
speed the captain was to be impressed with the duty of slackening
speed or of stopping the vessel as the occasion dictated, and the time
so lost was to be allowed to the contractor in addition to the time
specified for the length of the voyage.</p>

<p>Other precautions were taken by the contractor. The first
vessel lost&mdash;the "Canadian" in June 1857&mdash;was cast on shore by the
incompetency of the pilot, and the contractor made it his business
to secure the best pilots, instead of taking the first that presented
himself, as the practice had been. Another vessel was wrecked on
a dangerous shore of the Island of Anticosti. This channel was
thereafter abandoned by the vessels of the line.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these provisions and precautions, aided,
doubtless, by greater care on the part of the sailing masters,
accidents to the vessels ceased altogether. During the twenty-five
years that ensued there was but one vessel lost. The outstanding
feature of the whole business was the dogged resolution
of Allan to justify his faith in the possibility of the Canadian route,
and in his ultimate success he rendered an incalculable service
to Canada.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="chalign">Postal service of Manitoba, the North-West provinces and British Columbia&mdash;Summary
of progress since Confederation.</p></div>


<p>When Sir Adams Archibald, the first lieutenant governor of the
newly-formed province of Manitoba, reached Winnipeg in the
summer of 1870 for the purpose of taking over his government, he
made a survey of the administrative system which he found there.</p>

<p>The postal arrangements were very simple.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> There were but
four post offices in the province, and three mail routes. The
principal route, that upon which the settlement depended for its
communication with the outer world, ran down the Red River
from Pembina, on the border, to Winnipeg. The second followed
the river down as far as St. Andrew's; and the third connected
the town of Portage La Prairie with Winnipeg, by a weekly-courier
service along the Assiniboine river. The mails on the
other two routes were carried twice each week.</p>

<p>The carriage of the mails between Pembina and Winnipeg
was originally a private enterprise, but was afterwards assumed
by the government of Assiniboia. There was a postage charge
of one penny on all letters and of one-halfpenny on all newspapers,
passing in and out of the territory, in addition to the postage due
for conveyance between Pembina and the place of origin or
destination.</p>

<p>The system in the settlement was not recognized by the United
States government, and letters were not considered as regularly
posted until they were deposited in Pembina post office. Consequently
the only postage stamps were those of the United States,
which were sold in the post offices of the settlement.</p>

<p>The letters and newspapers passing between Winnipeg and
Pembina during the month of August 1870 were counted, and it
was found that within that period, there were 1018 letters and
196 newspapers sent from Winnipeg to Pembina, and 960 letters
and 1375 newspapers passed into the settlement.</p>

<p>The opportunity afforded by the extension of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
States postal service into the northern parts of Minnesota was a
great boon to the inhabitants of the isolated settlement. Until
that time, the only communication between the Red River and
the world outside was by means of the semi-annual packets, by
which the Hudson's Bay Company maintained its communication
with its posts, which were scattered over its vast territories.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Once in each year a vessel sailed from the Thames for York
Factory on the western shore of Hudson's Bay bringing the goods
used for barter with the Indians, and carrying back to London
the peltries which were the produce of the previous year's trade.
To meet this vessel, a brigade of dog-sleighs set out from fort
Garry about December 10, when, the ice having formed and the
snow fallen, travelling was easy. The first stopping place was at
Norway House, at the northern end of lake Winnipeg. The
distance, about 350 miles, was travelled in eight days.</p>

<p>Here the contents of the packet were separated, one portion
being detained for the posts in the west, and the other for York
Factory. The couriers with the mails from the ship in Hudson's
Bay connected at Norway House with those from Red River,
and after mails had been exchanged, each returned to his point
of departure. The mail from England reached fort Garry in
February.</p>

<p>The other means of communication was by the packet which
was despatched overland in the winter to Montreal. The courier
returned to the settlement in the spring, travelling by canoes
from Lachine up the Ottawa river and along the Mattawin to
lake Nipissing, thence down the French river to Georgian Bay.
Crossing the bay and lakes Huron and Superior, the travellers
entered the Kaministiquia at fort William, and passing by
alternate water stretches and portages into the Winnipeg river,
they made their way by canoe to lake Winnipeg, and landed at
the outlet of the Red River, eighteen miles north of fort Garry.
This journey occupied about six weeks.</p>

<p>The extent of the isolation of the settlement during the early
period is thus vividly described:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>"Thus matters went on during the first forty years of our
existence as a settlement. We were kept in blissful ignorance
of all that transpired abroad until about eight months after actual
occurrence. Our easy-going and self-satisfied gentry received
their yearly fyles of newspapers about a twelvemonth after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
date of the last publication, and read them with avidity, patiently
wading through the whole in a manner which did no violence to
chronology. Wars were undertaken and completed&mdash;protocolling
was at an end and peace signed, long before we could hear that a
musket had been shouldered or a cannon fired."</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay packets were placed at the service of the
settlers, but not quite without reserve. The company, which
employed the packets primarily for the conduct of their business,
did not intend that they should be used against their interests.
They had a monopoly of the fur-trade, which they proposed to
hold, as far as possible, intact. There were a number of traders
in the settlement, who bought on their own account, and made
use of such means of transport as they were able to discover, to
get their furs out of the country.</p>

<p>To prevent the operations of these interlopers, the company
had recourse to a measure which was vastly unpopular in the
settlement. The governor of Assiniboia, in a proclamation,
dated December 20, 1844, directed that all letters intended to
be despatched by the winter express, must be left at his office
on or before the 1st of January. Every letter must bear the
writer's name, and if the writer was not one of those who had
lodged a declaration against trafficking in furs, he was obliged to
deposit the letter open, to be closed at the governor's office.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
This obnoxious order remained in force until 1848.</p>

<p>This arbitrary measure on the part of the company excited
intense feelings among the settlers, and disposed them to hail
with satisfaction the approach of the lines of the American postal
service towards the company's southern borders. In 1853, when
the American government established a post office at fort Ripley,
a number of the settlers in the Red River settlement formed a
post office at fort Garry, and opened a monthly communication
with the post office in Minnesota.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> At the same time a post
office was also opened in the settlement of St. Andrews, fourteen
miles further down the Red River. In 1857, the United States
postal service was extended to the company's border, at Pembina,
and the infant system in the settlement was connected with this
office.</p>

<p>The relation of dependence, which the Red River settlement
was beginning to assume towards the United States, attracted
attention in Canada, and fears were expressed as to the political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
future of the great hinterland. In 1857, the Toronto board of
trade addressed a memorial to the government,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> pointing out the
situation in the north-west, and urged the expediency of establishing
a post route and telegraph line between Canada and British
Columbia, over Canadian and Hudson's Bay territory.</p>

<p>The government acted upon the suggestion without loss of
time. A mail service was opened in the summer of 1858 to the
Red River settlement.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Mails were carried twice a month between
Collingwood and fort William by steamer, and from the latter
point to the Red River by canoe. When winter closed the water
routes, a monthly packet by dog-sleigh carried the mails, the
carrier travelling along the north shore of lakes Huron and
Superior.</p>

<p>But this effort to establish a direct connection between Canada
and the north-west was not a success. The difficulties of travel
placed this route at a hopeless disadvantage with that through
the United States, which gave the people of the settlement a
direct communication with but seventy miles of transportation
on their part. The service was abandoned after two years, and
shortly afterwards the improvements in the service of Pembina
in the United States system, enabled the settlers on the Red
River to exchange mails with the outer world twice each week.</p>

<p>But the failure of this scheme was merely the prelude to the
greater scheme, advocated by the Toronto board of trade. The
Canadian government opened a correspondence with the Hudson's
Bay Company on the questions of a post road and telegraph
across the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> On its part, the government was prepared
to adopt any measure which would facilitate travel over the
stretch which lay between the settled parts of Canada and the
Hudson's Bay territory. Appropriations were made for roads
through to Red River, and it was hoped that free grants of land
would induce people to settle along the route.</p>

<p>The discovery of gold on the Saskatchewan, with the anticipated
influx of gold-seekers from the United States made the
question one of great urgency. The only access to the territories
was through the state of Minnesota, and it was feared that the
settlement at Red River would inevitably imbibe principles
inimical to the British interests. Unless Canada could offer a
passage into the territories, equal in accommodation to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
afforded by the United States, the territories would in no long
time be occupied by foreigners, British rule would virtually have
passed away, and the key to the trade to British Columbia and
ultimately to China surrendered to rivals.</p>

<p>Dallas, the resident governor of the Hudson's Bay Company,
looked at the question from the standpoint of the company's
interests. He pointed out that the establishment of a line of
communication across the territories of the company would be
seriously prejudicial to those interests. The Red River and
Saskatchewan valleys, though not in themselves fur-bearing
districts, were the sources from which the main supply of winter
food were procured for the northern posts, from the produce
of the buffalo hunts.</p>

<p>A chain of settlements through these valleys would not only
deprive the company of these vital resources, but would indirectly,
in other ways, so interfere with their northern trade as to render
it no longer worth prosecuting on an extended scale. It would
necessarily be diverted into various channels, possibly to the
public benefit, but the company could no longer exist on its
present footing.</p>

<p>The Canadian government was far from satisfied with this
answer. As they saw it, the question resolved itself into simply
this: Should these magnificent territories continue to be merely
the source of supply for a few hundreds of the employees of a
fur-trading company, or be the means of affording new and
boundless contributions to civilization and commerce? Should
they remain closed to the enterprise and industry of millions, in
order that a few might monopolize all their treasures and keep
them for all time to come, as the habitation of wild beasts and the
trappers engaged in their pursuit?</p>

<p>The postmaster general in making his report to the council
estimated that the cost of a road and water connections with Red
River would cost £80,000, and from that settlement to the passes
of the Rocky Mountains, £100,000, and recommended that the
Canadian parliament should appropriate $50,000 a year for a
number of years for this project.</p>

<p>The Red River settlement approached the Canadian government
on the subject, undertaking to build a road to the head of
the Lake of the Woods, if the Canadian or British government
would construct a practical passage from lake Superior to meet
this road. The British government, to whom a copy of this
memorial was sent by Sandford Fleming, replied that plans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
almost matured for establishing a postal and telegraphic communication
with British Columbia, and it was expected that with
the aid of the two colonies, the scheme would be entered upon at
no distant date.</p>

<p>An obstacle to the settlement of the plans lay in the indeterminate
nature of the claims of the Hudson's Bay Company to
the territory over which the means of communication should pass,
and the Canadian government declined to participate in the
project while these claims remained unsettled. They opened
correspondence with the British government with the view to
determine the questions in dispute, maintaining at the same time
the right of Canada to take over all that portion of central British
America which was in the possession of the French at the period
of the session in 1763.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The question of postal communication
was as a consequence postponed to the larger question of
Canada's acquiring these territories, and this was not settled
until 1870.</p>

<p>In 1865, the Hudson's Bay Company sent Dr. John Rae, the
Arctic explorer, to ascertain the practicability of establishing
communication by telegraph across the continent. His report
was favourable, and the company went so far into the scheme as
to send a quantity of telegraph wire into the territory. But as
their continued ownership and monopoly of the territory became
increasingly uncertain, the company suspended operations, and
these were not resumed.</p>

<p>In April 1862 the governor and council of Assiniboia by an
ordinance established a postal system in the settlement. James
Ross was appointed postmaster in the middle section of the
settlement, with a salary of £10 per annum; and Thomas
Sinclair, postmaster of the lower section, with a salary of £6
per annum. A mail was to be carried between the settlement
and Pembina at the public expense, in connection with
the United States mail to Pembina. The postal charges between
the settlement and Pembina were fixed at a penny per half ounce
for letters, twopence for each magazine or review, and one-halfpenny
for each newspaper. For books, the charges were fivepence for
half a pound or under, one shilling for one and a half pounds,
and twopence for each additional half pound.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>This embryo system was in operation when Sir Adams Archibald
arrived in the new province as lieutenant governor. He
lost no time in putting the system on as efficient a footing as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
circumstances permitted, and in incorporating it into the postal
system of the dominion.</p>

<p>The postmaster general arranged with the post office department
of the United States for the transmission across its territory
by way of Chicago and St. Paul, of mails between Windsor,
Ontario and Winnipeg. The postal rates in force in the dominion
were applied to the new province; and in November the post
offices were provided with Canadian postage stamps, to replace
those of the United States, which had been used until that time.</p>

<p>The means of transportation through the United States was
gradually improved, and advantage was taken of these ameliorations
to improve the communication of Manitoba. In 1879 the
completion of the railway between the Pembina and Winnipeg
left little to be desired in the facilities enjoyed by the province
for the exchange of correspondence. But it was still dependent
on the good will of the United States for these facilities. It was
not until 1884 that the completion of the Canadian Pacific railway
between Winnipeg and eastern Canada provided a connection
across Canadian territory.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The need for a regular postal service in British Columbia did
not arise until 1858, the year in which the gold discoveries in the
mainland brought large numbers of miners to seek their fortunes
in that country. The colony of Vancouver Island had been in
the process of settlement by the Hudson's Bay Company since
1849, but the success of the company had been but moderate.
The whole population in 1856&mdash;scarcely equal to that of a small
town&mdash;was gathered together in Victoria and its environs, and
their requirements as regards correspondence were limited to a
communication with Great Britain.</p>

<p>The home government gave early attention to the question
of providing these means. On August 3, 1858, the day after
the act providing for the government of the new colony had been
adopted, the colonial secretary wrote to the treasury, pointing
out that the establishment of the new colony, and the large influx
of immigrants thereto, made it desirable that some safe and
regular communication should be formed between the colony and
the kingdom, and asking that the lords commissioners should
consider the possibility of such a suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The treasury consulted the admiralty and the post office.
Neither department could suggest a scheme which would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
involve an outlay much beyond the ideas of the treasury as to
the importance of the objects to be attained. The post office
proposed sending mails to Colon, at the entrance to the Panama
railway by the steamers of the Royal Mail Packet Company,
thence to Panama by railway. The voyage occupied from sixteen
to twenty days and the passage across the isthmus about five hours.</p>

<p>The conveyance from Panama to Victoria offered greater
difficulties. The connection between British mail steamers arriving
at Colon and the United States steamers running from Panama
to San Francisco, was so faulty, that the mails would have to lie
at Panama as long as two weeks before they were taken forward.
The passage to San Francisco occupied two weeks, and from this
point to Victoria from four to five days. The delay at the isthmus
was usually avoided by taking the steamer from England to New
York, from whence a line of steamers ran to Colon in close connection
with the Pacific steamers from Panama. By the latter
route the journey from London to Victoria was made in about
forty-five days.</p>

<p>But the important consideration with the treasury was the
very considerable cost. The preference of the government was
for an all-British conveyance. This could be arranged by having
a steamer, subsidized by the government, take the mails from the
Cunard vessels at either Halifax or New York, and carry them to
Colon, and by providing other vessels under its control to make
the conveyance from Panama to Victoria. The enormous cost
of these services precluded the adoption of this scheme, until
the colony had grown to an extent that it could bear, at least,
part of the cost. It was estimated that the steamer on the
Atlantic coast would call for an outlay of £25,000 a year, while
the Pacific line would cost not less than £100,000 a year.</p>

<p>A solution of the difficulty was found through the good offices
of the United States government. There was a service carried
on twice a week between St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco.
The route was 2,765 miles in length, and it was covered by four-horse
coaches with great regularity in twenty-two days.</p>

<p>This service, the United States government placed at the
disposal of the British post office for the exchange of its correspondence
with its distant colony. The mails on their arrival at
San Francisco were delivered to the British consul, who arranged
for their transmission to their destination.</p>

<p>At the best, the isolation of the new settlement was extreme.
There had been a newspaper in Victoria since June 1858. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
published weekly, and for two weeks out of three, its columns
were confined to purely local news. The third issue presented
the appearance of a modern newspaper. The steamer "Eliza
Anderson" had arrived from Olympia, bringing with it the
despatches from San Francisco, containing news from all parts
of the world.</p>

<p>How belated the news was may be gathered from a glance over
one of the issues. The issue of March 9 contained news from San
Francisco, not later than February 8, and from St. Louis, the
latest date was February 5. As St. Louis was within the eastern
telegraph system, the papers from the city contained despatches
from all parts of the United States and Canada. It was observed
that among the items of news was the arrival of the steamer
"Bohemia" at New York, with the Liverpool newspapers of January
18. So that under ordinary circumstances, news from England
was fifty days old before it reached the public in Victoria.</p>

<p>The construction of a telegraph line to the Pacific in the
autumn of 1861, and the extension of the lines of the California
State Telegraphic Company to Portland, Oregon, in 1864, did
much to relieve the situation, so far as concerned news important
enough to be sent by telegraph to the newspapers in San Francisco.</p>

<p>But the ordinary news from Canada did not reach Victoria
by telegraph, and the length of the delay in the transmission of
news from Canada by letter may be seen from the fact that the
<i>British Colonist</i> of November 11, 1864, contained a newsletter
from Canada, dated September 30&mdash;six weeks earlier. Governor
Kennedy in his annual report to the colonial secretary on the
state of the colony in 1864 observed that "expensive and defective
postal and other communications are the great bar to progress,
and reflect but little credit on the two great nations&mdash;England
and America. A <i>Times</i> newspaper costs fourpence postage, and
that for a book is entirely prohibitory."</p>

<p>Arrangements of a simple character were made for the conveyance
of letters into the sections occupied by the miners. In
November 1858, governor Douglas reported that the men at the
mines&mdash;nearly all of whom were on the course of the Fraser river&mdash;numbered
10,500. He also stated that he had arranged a
postal system on a small scale, which provided for the wants of
the country, at an expenditure which was fully covered by the
receipts.</p>

<p>The earliest letter delivery in this region was carried on by
the express companies, whose operations were extended from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
California to British Columbia, with the migration of the miners
to the newly-discovered gold districts. This mode of delivery is
described by a British naval officer, who spent four years in the
country, as one of the safest imaginable. He states that "so
great is his faith in them that he would trust anything in even
that most insecure country (California) in an envelope bearing
the stamp of the Wells Fargo and Company's express."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>In May 1858 the colonial administration arranged with the
private expresses for conveyance of letters anywhere within the
colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island on condition
of the prepayment of five cents per letter, as colonial postage.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>This rudimentary arrangement was replaced in 1864 by a
regular departmental postal service with headquarters at New
Westminster.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The charges on letters and newspapers sent by
post were fixed as follows: for every letter to and from British
Columbia and Vancouver Island, delivered at Victoria or New
Westminster, threepence per half ounce; on every newspaper
posted under the same circumstances, one penny; on every letter
from a post office at any one place in the colony to a post office
at any other place in the colony, sixpence per half ounce; for a
newspaper posted for delivery under the same circumstances,
sixpence; on letters from any other place than Vancouver Island,
threepence in addition to the foreign postage.</p>

<p>The year following the union of the two governments of British
Columbia and Vancouver Island, an ordinance was passed by the
government, dated April 2, 1867, in which a new set of rates
were established. On a letter passing between any two post
offices in Vancouver Island or between any of these offices and
New Westminster or any port in the colony, the rate was five
cents; between Vancouver Island or New Westminster on the
one side and Clinton or Savona's Ferry, the rate was twelve and
a half cents; where letters pass beyond those distances the charge
was twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>For letters exchanged between any two post offices above
Yale, Hope or Douglas, the rate was twelve and a half cents. In
each case the unit of weight was an ounce. The charge on newspapers
passing between any two post offices in the colony was
two cents each. At this period there were eighteen post offices
on the mainland and eight on the island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation of the post office in British Columbia stood thus
when the colony became one of the provinces of the dominion.
By the act of confederation the postal service was incorporated
into the Federal system which was administered by the post
office department at Ottawa. The rates of postage in British
Columbia were made uniform with the charges in the other
provinces, viz., three cents per half ounce for letters, and one cent
for newspapers.</p>

<p>Communication between British Columbia and Canada east
of the Rocky Mountains was far from satisfactory. Until the
completion of the Canadian Pacific railway in 1885, the eastern
provinces had to depend entirely upon the United States postal
system for the means of communication with British Columbia.
At the time of the entrance of the province into the confederation,
the opportunities for an exchange of correspondence were limited
to twice a week.</p>

<p>The mails were conveyed from San Francisco by railway and
stage to Olympia, between which point and Victoria, semi-weekly
trips were made by steamer. There was also a service twice a
month, between Victoria and San Francisco. The maintenance
of these connections between San Francisco and Vancouver Island
was stipulated for among the conditions of union of British
Columbia with the dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>Within the province, the mails were carried by the steamer
"Sir James Douglas" along the east coast of Vancouver Island and
Comox. The mainland was supplied with mails by a steamer
which ran twice a week between Vancouver and New Westminster.
In the interior of the province, the mails were carried by steamer
up the Fraser river to Yale, thence northward to Barkerville.
The distance between New Westminster and Barkerville was
486 miles. The service from Yale to Barkerville was by means
of stages, drawn by four or six horses. This service was carried
on weekly during summer, and fortnightly during the winter.
Striking off westward from this route at Quesnelle, there was
another to Omenica, 350 miles, over which the mails were carried
monthly.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>In bringing the narrative to a point where the several provincial
systems were incorporated into one system controlled by
the post office department at Ottawa, I have completed the task
I undertook. It remains only to note in a summary manner the
progress that was made by the post office from Confederation to
the Great War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
On the formation of the present department, there were 3477
post offices in the system. In 1914 this number had been increased
to 13,811. The expansion of the lines of the service in the four
older provinces, though considerable, is not comparable with that
in the provinces comprehended in the territories west of the
Great Lakes. In Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the better
settled parts of Quebec and Ontario, the characteristic of the
increase is the greater frequency of travel on already established
roads, and, particularly, the acceleration of correspondence by
the introduction of railways into the parts of the provinces.</p>

<p>In 1867 there were but 2278 miles of railway in Canada. In
the forty-seven years which followed this mileage was augmented
to 30,795.</p>

<p>The narrow line of settlement in Ontario from the Quebec
boundary to Toronto had expanded to a breadth, covering the
extent of country from lake Ontario to the watershed, dividing
the waters flowing south from those running into Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>But the great expansion has taken place in the provinces on
the plains between the Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountains&mdash;in
the New Canada beyond the Great Lakes. On entering
Confederation, the postal arrangements in this vast territory
comprised but six post offices, with a system of mail service of no
more than 145 miles. Since 1867 a system has been created in
these western provinces containing in 1914 over 42,000 miles, of
which 16,500 miles are of railroad. The number of post offices
in this year was 3402.</p>

<p>The expansion in British Columbia if not equal in magnitude
to that in the prairie and grain-growing provinces, keeps full pace
with the requirements of that province. There were thirty post
offices in the province in 1871 when the colony entered Confederation.
These had increased to 799 in 1914. The system in the
earlier period comprised 3412 miles. This had increased to over
12,000 miles in 1914; of these 3200 were by railroad, and 5000
by steam or sailing vessel.</p>

<p>The outstanding feature of the interchange of correspondence
between the several provinces at the time they entered Confederation
is the dependence on the postal service of the United States
for the means by which it was carried on. As between the old
province of Canada and the Maritime provinces, there was indeed
a mail service by coach between Truro, sixty miles west of Halifax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and Riviere du Loup, 120 miles east of Quebec. But, apart from
the fact that the trips were made no more frequently than three
times a week, the utter inadequacy of such a mode of conveyance
over a route 485 miles in length was obvious to those who could
use the railways of the United States for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The provinces had been united politically for nine years before
the completion of the inter-colonial railway provided the means
of direct communication between them. Until 1876 the usual
course for the mails between the Maritime provinces and the old
province of Canada was by railway from St. John, New Brunswick
to Bangor, Maine, thence to Portland, where connection was made
with the Grand Trunk system.</p>

<p>As the western provinces came into the Confederation they
exhibited in an even more marked degree the dependence on the
good will of the United States for communication with the older
provinces. The construction of the Canadian Pacific railway
westward around the head of lake Superior and the continuance
of its course across the plains of the north-west territories, and
over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, gradually relaxed
that dependence.</p>

<p>But Manitoba had been a province of the dominion for fourteen
years before the first train ran over an all-Canadian route
between that province and Ontario, and it was two years later
before British Columbia was linked up with its sister provinces
by this means.</p>

<p>During these periods the mails for Manitoba were despatched
from Windsor by way of Chicago, St. Paul's and Pembina, Dakota:
those for British Columbia, by way of San Francisco. Fortunately,
the geographical position of Canada with reference to the
western and north-western states, enabled the post office of
this country to reciprocate, more or less adequately, the services
rendered in the maintenance of communication between the
several provinces.</p>

<p>Concurrently with the expansion of the postal system has
gone a steady reduction in the postal rates. The charge of five
cents per half ounce on letters was lowered to three cents per half
ounce in the first session of parliament after Confederation. The
effect of the reduction on the volume of correspondence exchanged
was manifested in the fact that, although the reduction was the
very considerable one of forty per cent., the revenue in 1871
was greater by $55,000 than the amount collected three years
before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>The rate of three cents per half ounce, which was fixed in 1868,
remained unchanged for twenty-one years, when the unit of
weight was changed from half an ounce to one ounce, the rate
becoming in 1889 three cents per ounce. The final reduction in
the rate was made on January 1, 1899, two cents being substituted
for three cents as the rate of postage for an ounce letter.</p>

<p>In 1878 Canada became a member of the Universal Postal
Union, an organization whose purpose it was to make in effect a
single postal territory of the whole world. The obstacles to the
interchange of correspondence between the various countries
owing to differences in charges and regulations, had long been
felt as a serious impediment to the cultivation of social and commercial
relations which there was a general desire to foster, and
some tentative efforts had been made, notably by the United
States, to ameliorate the conditions governing international
correspondence by the establishment of uniform regulations for
this class of correspondence.</p>

<p>Twenty-two states, comprising the leading countries in Europe,
the United States, and Egypt sent delegates to a conference that
assembled at Berne in 1874, and the result of their deliberations
was a convention which established a code of regulations and
fixed uniform postage rates respecting correspondence passing
anywhere within the union.</p>

<p>The benefits conferred by the union on those, who, for any
reason, had to carry on correspondence with foreign countries
were inestimable. Some illustrations drawn from the case of
Canada will be enlightening. In 1873 letters sent to India were
subject to two different rates, according to the route by which
they were directed. If sent by Canadian steamers to Great
Britain, and thence on to their destination, the charge was twenty-two
cents; if sent by the United States, the charge was thirteen
cents. To Chili, Peru, and Ecuador, there were two routes and
two rates; by way of England, the charge was forty cents, by
way of the United States, twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>The extreme instance of variation in the charges according to
the route chosen was in the case of letters from the United States
to Australia. There were six different routes, and the postal
guide set out the different charges: five cents, thirty-three cents,
forty-five cents, fifty-five cents, sixty cents, and one dollar,
according to the route by which the letters were sent.</p>

<p>Difficulties of an accounting nature arising from different
standards of weights hampered the operations of the officials in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
preparing the mails. Thus a letter from Great Britain to Germany,
passing through France was taxed at a certain rate per half
ounce in England, another rate per ten grams in France, and,
finally, a third rate per loth<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> in Germany.</p>

<p>Many of these trammels to correspondence were removed by
special conventions before the Postal Union came into being.
But how many remained may be judged from the fact that the
Canadian postal guide, issued shortly before Canada was admitted
to the Postal Union, contained a list of rates to 127 different
countries, which must be consulted by correspondents and postal
officials before the charge on a letter going abroad could be
ascertained.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of coming into the union was the removal
of these extensive and complicated lists from the postal guide,
and their replacement by a single sentence, in which the charge
on letters for all the countries in the union was stated to be five
cents per half ounce. The Postal Union did not at that time
comprehend all countries, though it did all the most important,
but since then adhesions have been made from year to year until
to-day there is scarcely a country to which letters are written,
which does not come within its scope.</p>

<p>In 1898, at Canada's instance, a closer union was formed for
penny postage within the British Empire. It went into effect
on Christmas day of that year. It did not include all parts of
the Empire at the time it was formed, Australia being deterred
from associating itself with the scheme, by financial considerations.</p>

<p>A few years ago Australia found itself able to adjust the
difficulties with which it was confronted when the union was
formed, and the imperial penny postage scheme is operative in
all parts of the Empire.</p>

<p>In 1903 the postmaster general of Canada opened negotiations
with the administrations of the various parts of the Empire for a
reduction of the postal rates on newspapers. His proposition was
to allow newspapers to circulate throughout the Empire at the
same rates as were charged for their transmission within the
countries from which they were sent. The proposition encountered
much opposition at the outset, but it made gradual progress,
and to-day a newspaper may be sent from Canada to Great
Britain and several other portions of the Empire at the same rate
as would carry it from one place to another in Canada.</p>

<p>The auxiliary postal services&mdash;the money order and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
savings bank&mdash;have expanded in their operations enormously
between the period of Confederation and the present time. In
1868 there were 515 money order offices in the provinces comprising
the dominion, and the amount of the orders issued by them
was $3,342,574. The corresponding figures for 1914 were 4274
offices, which issued orders to the amount of $118,731,966.</p>

<p>The post office savings bank was not in operation prior to
Confederation. It was established in April 1868, and at the end
of the first year 213 post offices were charged with the duty of
receiving and paying out savings deposits. The deposits at the
end of the first year amounted to $861,655. In 1914 there were
1250 post offices doing savings bank business, and the deposits
amounted to $11,346,457, and the balance standing at the credit
of depositors was $41,591,286.</p>

<p>The financial operations of the Canadian post office have
undergone a great expansion. The revenues which at the end of
the first year of Confederation were $1,024,711, have, in spite of
the steady reduction in the charges, been multiplied sixteen-fold
within the forty-eight years since that period. In 1914 the
amount collected for its services reached $16,865,451.</p>

<p>It is interesting, as illustrating the much greater use made of
the post office by the public in Canada, to note that while the
revenue has increased sixteen times, the population has not much
more than doubled within the same period. In 1868, when the
population of the four original provinces was given as 3,879,885,
the amount paid to the post office was $1,024,711; in 1914, when
the population was 8,075,000 the revenue was $16,865,451. Thus,
notwithstanding the fact that for every letter posted during the
first year of Confederation five cents was exacted by the post
office, while in 1914 two cents only was demanded, the average
expenditure for each member of the population was in 1868,
rather less than twenty-seven cents, while in 1914 it was a small
fraction over two dollars.</p>

<p>The Canadian post office has been on a sound footing as a
business institution for a number of years past. This fact is
more notable than would perhaps appear. The postal system of
this country embraces a territory more extended than that served
by any other system on earth, except the United States and
Russia; and the population to utilize its services, and thereby
furnish its revenues, is very much less <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'that that'">than that</ins> of either of these
countries.</p>

<p>Circumstances, incident to the expansion of settlement or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
providing of new facilities, are constantly arising, which compel
the department to embark on expenditures from which adequate
returns can be expected only in the distant future.</p>

<p>As instances, when Manitoba and the north-west territories
were added to the dominion, one of the early measures of the
department was to establish a line of mail route from Winnipeg
to Edmonton, at a cost of $10,000, while the receipts from the
whole north-west territories was considerably less than $100.
The completion of the Canadian Pacific railway to Vancouver in
1885 involved the department in outlays, which exceeded the
revenues by over $200,000 a year.</p>

<p>Nor has it been only by the weight of unavoidable expenditure
that the department has been impeded in its efforts to make ends
meet. The policy of the government has also operated to deprive
it of what in all other countries is regarded as a source of legitimate
revenue.</p>

<p>Newspapers have always been circulated through Canada by
the post office on terms most advantageous to the public. In
1875 publishers were permitted to send their papers to subscribers
at the rate of one cent per pound. Even this small charge was
removed in 1882, and for the following seventeen years newspapers
addressed to subscribers were exempt from all charges.</p>

<p>In 1899 a small charge was imposed, which, after some variations,
was fixed at a quarter cent per pound. As the cost to the
post office of handling and transmitting newspapers is estimated
as from four cents to six cents per pound, it is clear that the loss
to the department on this head reaches a large amount each year.
In spite of these facts, however, the revenues of the department
have steadily increased, and since 1903, when they first surpassed
the outlay, they have maintained an ascendancy which it is
improbable will be overcome.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">The post office in Newfoundland.</p></div>


<p>The position of Newfoundland, as regards postal requirements,
was very similar to that of the other colonies situated on the
Atlantic seaboard. The social and commercial relations of the
island were almost exclusively with the mother country, and
the trade was from an early period very considerable. A number
of vessels sailed each year from the ports of Great Britain to those
of the colony, which provided the means for the interchange of
correspondence.</p>

<p>On this side but one thing was needed&mdash;a fixed place in St.
Johns at which letters for despatch by outgoing vessels could be
deposited, and at which captains on their arrival could deliver
the letters with which they had been entrusted in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The first post office was established in 1806 by Sir Erasmus
Gower, who appointed Simon Solomon postmaster. The governor
communicated with the secretary of the general post office, who
though not prepared to include Newfoundland in the British postal
system, promised to forward all letters addressed to the island,
by the first outgoing vessels. Three years later, the number of
merchants settled at Brigus, Harbour Grace and Carbonear on
Conception Bay made necessary an arrangement, by which the
letters reaching St. John for any of those places were forwarded
to their destination by any vessels which might be going thither.</p>

<p>The charge on letters passing through the London post office
to Newfoundland was one shilling and threepence, if conveyed to
Halifax by packet, and eightpence, if sent by private vessel, to
which sums was added the postage from the place in Great Britain
at which the letter was deposited, to London. There can be little
doubt that but a small proportion of the correspondence passing
between Newfoundland and Great Britain was exchanged by these
expensive means. Advantage would be taken of the departure
of any vessel, to place the letters in charge of the captain, who
would collect the sum of a penny or twopence for each letter from
the person to whom he delivered them at the port of arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>The course of post within the island was also very expensive.
The owners of sailing vessels running between St. John's and ports
on Conception Bay collected a shilling for each single letter they
delivered.</p>

<p>Governor Cochrane, in 1826, appealed to the postmaster general
in London to establish a regular post office in St. John's, in order
that his despatches from the colonial office might reach him with
security. Failing that, he asked that the despatches might be
sent, to a company in London, which was in constant communication
with Newfoundland.</p>

<p>The chamber of commerce of St. John's, in 1836, presented a
memorial to the colonial office, asking that the sailing packets
running between Falmouth and Halifax might call at St. John's
on their voyages. But the governor, in forwarding the memorial,
deprecated the application, on account of the fogs and gales which
prevail on those coasts, and the ignorance of the sailing masters
regarding the localities. The admiralty refused to entertain the
application.</p>

<p>With the establishment in 1840 of the Cunard steamship line
to run between Halifax and Liverpool, and the inauguration of
the scheme to make the Nova Scotia port the distributing centre
for the mails for all parts of North America, provision was made
for a sailing vessel of not less than 120 tons to leave Halifax for
St. John's in connection with the steamer arriving at Halifax, and
the post office at St. John's was incorporated into the imperial
system. The postmaster, Simon Solomon, who had died in December
1839, was succeeded by his son, William Lemon Solomon,
and the latter was placed on the pay-roll of the general post office
with a salary of £100 per annum.</p>

<p>Governor Prescott gave his attention to the inland post office
and endeavoured to have established a regular colonial system,
but the assembly to which he directed his recommendation did
not act upon it. The governor had, however, managed to secure
to the postmaster some regular compensation for his services in
attending to the exchanges on the island.</p>

<p>There was at this period a communication every second day
with the ports of Brigus, Harbour Grace and Carbonear, by a sailing
vessel, which carried passengers and letters. The postmaster
received a payment of sixpence each upon all letters, and twopence
on all newspapers received from other places, and twopence each
upon letters despatched from his office. This brought him an
income of between £30 and £40 a year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>The establishment of the post office and its peremptory intervention
in the exchange of communications between the merchants
of St. John's and their correspondents abroad was a novelty, which
was not wholly welcomed in that city. Although the post office
had been at their service for thirty-five years, it was without official
authority to claim exclusive right to the transmission of correspondence.
The merchants could use it or not as suited their
convenience.</p>

<p>There were few communities that could dispense with the
benefits of a post office more easily than St. John's. The merchants
all did business on Water Street, and their warehouses looked out
on the harbour; consequently the arrival or departure of a vessel
was known to every person interested, and letters could be placed
in the hands of an outgoing captain or received from one who had
just arrived, with the least possible inconvenience. They could
be delivered up to the last moment before the vessel left the harbour,
and received as soon as it had been made fast at the docks.</p>

<p>The necessary formalities of a post office proved inexpressibly
irksome to the merchants of St. John's, and Solomon was made to
feel the irritations of their impatience. He seems to have been one
of those officials who make much of the functions of their offices.
He delighted in the parti-coloured pencils, which his regulations
prescribed. He was indignant with the merchants, who could not
be made to understand why he used a red pencil to indicate that a
letter had been prepaid, and a blue one to show the receiving postmaster
in England that the postage had not been paid. All the
trappings dear to the accountant's soul, were to them merely
hindrances to the prompt posting and receiving of their letters.</p>

<p>Then there were difficulties of another sort. One of the merchants
was notified that there was a packet in the post office for
him, on which postage to the amount of five shillings and threepence
was due. He, at first, refused to accept the packet, declaring that
it could only contain newspapers, but, yielding to curiosity, he
took it, and finding his surmise to be correct, endeavoured to return
the packet to the postmaster, declining to pay the postage. The
postmaster reported the case to England for instructions. He
was told that the acceptance of the parcel carried with it the necessity
on the part of the merchant of paying the postage, but whether
the postmaster succeeded in bringing the recalcitrant merchant
to a sense of his obligation is not recorded.</p>

<p>The postal situation in Newfoundland remained unchanged
until 1848, when Elgin, the governor general, of the British North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
American provinces announced to the government of the island,
that the British government had decided to grant autonomy to
the several administrations in the colony, and called a conference
in Montreal to settle the questions arising from this concession.</p>

<p>Newfoundland was not represented at the conference, but the
decisions adopted and the course taken by the other colonies stimulated
the Newfoundland government to establish a postal system
within the island. On April 26, 1850, a committee of the assembly
was appointed to inquire into the subject. That the question had
been fully discussed before this action was taken by the assembly
is evident from the fact that three days later the report of the
committee was presented to the house.</p>

<p>The interval between the time of its appointment and the date
on which it made its report precluded the committee from making
anything like exhaustive inquiries. They were satisfied, however,
from the information they had obtained as to the volume of correspondence
passing to and from the ports of Conception Bay, that
a scheme would be practicable for establishing a system, which
should carry postal facilities to the principal settlements as far
north as Twillingate and as far as Gaultois on the south-west coast.
They were encouraged to make the proposition by the rapid progress
made by the post office at St. John's during the eight years of its
operation. The revenue of this office had increased from £595 in
1841 to £1545 in 1849.</p>

<p>The committee proposed as an interim measure that the stipendiary
magistrates in the ports at which post offices should be
established, might be called upon to act as postmasters in those
places. The foundation of the service to the north would be a
conveyance by messenger from St. John's to Portugal Cove. From
this point, a sailing vessel would carry the mails to Brigus, Harbour
Grace and Carbonear; from Carbonear, a messenger would cross
the peninsula to Heart's Content on Trinity Bay; a sailing vessel
would serve Trinity and Catalina on the other side of the bay, and
from the latter point a messenger would continue the transmission
to Bonavista. From Bonavista, the mails would be carried to
the outermost points of the system, Greenspond, King's Cove,
Cat Harbour, Fogo and Twillingate, by vessel and messenger.
It was estimated that the several services within this part of the
system would cost £575 a year.</p>

<p>To the south, there would be couriers down the coast to Trepassey,
serving Ferryland on the way; and to Placentia, by way
of Salmonier and St. Mary's; thence on to Gaultois with stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
places at Burin and Garnish. The southern route should be covered
for £325 a year. These routes would displace services by vessel
to Placentia, Bonavista and Fogo, as well as couriers to Ferryland
and St. Mary's, which with expenses for the incidentals were a
charge of £520 upon the colony. It was expected that the improved
services proposed would provide travelling accommodation for
the judges, school inspectors and other officials, and by the savings
thus effected, the increased outlay for the postal system would be
largely made up.</p>

<p>In the following year (1851) an act was passed by the legislature
providing £1000 for the establishment and maintenance of the
inland post office proposed by the committee. The appointment
of all postmasters was vested in the governor, and the management
of the system was to be placed in the hands of the postmaster of
St. John's. His salary was to be £75 a year (doubtless in addition
to the £100 sterling, which he held under his imperial appointment),
the postmasters of Harbour Grace and Carbonear were to receive,
each, £15 a year, and the other postmasters £10.</p>

<p>The postage on letters passing anywhere within the island
was fixed at threepence per half ounce; and on books, twopence
where the weight did not exceed six ounces, and threepence on
greater weights up to sixteen ounces. The scheme outlined came
into operation on October 15, 1851.</p>

<p>The first report of the postmaster general was a serious disappointment.
The total receipts for the year amounted to no
more than £52 2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, and this amount was received entirely
from St. John's and the three offices on Conception Bay. Letters,
on which postage somewhat under £6 was due, were sent
to other offices, but not one penny was collected upon them. The
committee of the assembly which examined the accounts inclined
to the opinion that the postal system might, for the time, be
restricted to the offices on Conception Bay.</p>

<p>Solomon was rather alarmed by these expressions of the committee,
and in his next report he dealt, in some fulness, with the
peculiar difficulties that attended the establishment of a postal
system in the colony. No very great regularity, he declared, could
be anticipated while the couriers were retarded by the marshy and
swampy nature of the roads on the most important lines. Under the
most favourable circumstances, their journeys were made over mere
tracks or footpaths, while the less frequented routes lay through
wilds where neither roads nor paths had been formed and where
unbridged rivers and streams had to be crossed, the couriers being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
often obliged to wade to a considerable depth, exposed to strong,
rapid currents.</p>

<p>The postmaster general acknowledged that it was on his advocacy
of the system that Delaney, the chairman of the committee, introduced
the subject into the assembly. He was under no illusions
as to the rapid growth of the revenue; his object was to secure
to the inhabitants, who were excluded for the greater part of every
year from the advantage of communication with the capital, a
ready means of maintaining intercourse with the centre of the
social and commercial life of the island. He was encouraged by
the increasing revenue to believe that his efforts were being crowned
with success.</p>

<p>The step the committee feared might be forced upon them
was not taken. On the contrary, the postal system was extended
liberally in every direction in which it seemed to be required, in
adherence to the principle which guided the postmaster general
in advocating the inland service.</p>

<p>In 1858, the colony, having decided on the desirability of direct
communication with the mother country, sent to England two
delegates&mdash;Little, the attorney general and Lawrence O'Brien&mdash;to
confer with the government and leading shipowners on the subject
of a steam service from a British port to St. John's. When
the delegates made their first report, they had not succeeded in
their objects, but they were encouraged by the recognition accorded
to the scheme by the British government and by the promise of a
subsidy of £3000 a year to any satisfactory service the government
of Newfoundland might arrange for.</p>

<p>It was not long before plans were submitted for their consideration.
In the same year, the North Atlantic Royal Mail Steam
Navigation Company laid before Little a proposition for a regular
service between Liverpool, St. John's and a port in the United
States. The company were prepared to undertake a contract
for trips of a frequency of not less than one every four weeks, with
additional trips during April, July and August, for £10,000 a year.
A contract was made on this basis, the understanding being
that the British government would contribute £3000 of this amount.
But the British government, being satisfied from earlier experiences
with the personnel of this company that they could not be depended
upon to fulfil their arrangement, declined to sanction the contract,
and the arrangement fell through.</p>

<p>In intimating to the Newfoundland government their refusal
to endorse the contract, the British government expressed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
willingness to assist in procuring a competent contractor; and in
October of the same year, an agreement was made with the Atlantic
Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company, known more generally
as the Lever or Galway Company, for a service of virtually the
same frequency as that provided for in the earlier contract, between
Galway, St. John's and a United States port. The rate of compensation
was to be £13,000 a year, of which the British government
was to contribute £4500 a year.</p>

<p>Though for political reasons, this company enjoyed an unusual
degree of favour on the part of the British government, it failed
entirely to satisfy the conditions of the contract, and after a short
period of futile effort, it ceased altogether. It was not until 1872
that an arrangement with the Allan line provided the first direct
communication with Great Britain.</p>

<p>In 1860, on the death of Solomon, John Delaney, who had
made the postal service his special care while a member of the
assembly, was appointed postmaster general. His first measure was
to provide for St. John's what he described as a penny delivery
service. After consultation with the chief post office inspector in
Canada, he submitted his scheme to the legislature. He proposed
to divide the city into two sections, to each of which he proposed to
appoint a letter carrier to deliver the letters from door to door,
not gratuitously as at present, but for a compensation of a penny
for each letter delivered. The plan was put into operation on
September 1, 1863, but it had little success at the time.</p>

<p>Steps were also taken in 1863 to improve the accommodation to
the outports by substituting a steam vessel for the sailing boats,
by which the exchange of mails was effected. In November 1860,
a contract was made with Aaron DeGraw, of New York, for a service
north and south from St. John's. The steamer "Victoria" was
to run twice in each month to Twillingate on the north, and to
La Poile on the south-west coast, calling at all the post offices <i>en
route</i>. The consideration was £3750 a year.</p>

<p>The contract provided for the service for five years. But a
few months after it went into operation, the contractor represented
that he was unable to continue, unless the terms were modified.
He asked that the trips on the northern section might be reduced
from fortnightly to monthly during the winter, and that he might
omit certain of the ports of call; or, if the legislature were unwilling
to lower their requirements, that he might have his compensation
increased by £1500 a year.</p>

<p>The application of DeGraw was not entertained by the legislature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
and the contractor dropped his service shortly after. Recourse
was had to the sailing vessels until 1863, when a more satisfactory
arrangement was concluded with Robert Grieve on June
2, 1863. The contract stipulated for fortnightly trips in each
direction, and the compensation was fixed at £4500. The "Ariel"
was the steamer employed by Grieve for the service.</p>

<p>The coastal service, thus satisfactorily established from St.
John's down the east and along the south coasts as far as La Poile,
was extended to Port aux Basques on the south-west corner of the
island by a sailing vessel. This completed the postal communications
on the southern shore of the island.</p>

<p>The west coast was still to be comprised in the system. In
1873, arrangements of an experimental nature were made to send
mails from Port aux Basques (or Channel as the post office was
called) to St. George's Bay, Bay of Islands and Bonne Bay on this
coast. A courier service was also set in operation to provide communications
to those settlements during the winter, but many
difficulties were encountered owing to the inacquaintance with
the country on the part of the couriers, who had to pass on their
way between Channel and these bays.</p>

<p>The arrangement thus experimentally entered upon continued
until 1881, when the sailing craft, which carried the mails to Bonne
Bay was withdrawn, and the steamer "Curlew," by which Channel
post office received its mails from St. John's, extended its trips
up the north-west coast as far as Bonne Bay.</p>

<p>The conveyance of the mails up this coast was carried on to the
top of the island in the following year. Two trips were made by
couriers from Bonne Bay to Flower Cove at the gulf entrance to
the straits of Belle Isle. From Flower Cove, the journey of the
courier ran along the shore of the straits to Pistolet Bay at the
northernmost point of the island, and thence on the Griquet which
looked from the north of the island on the Atlantic, and down the
Atlantic coast to St. Anthony.</p>

<p>Another courier set out from Flower Cove and travelling due
east across the island carried the mail to Conche, which served the
settlements on Hare Bay. At the same time that the process of
encirclement was proceeding from the western side, the settlements
of Western Cove, Mings and Coachman's Cove on White
Bay, the northernmost of the series of great bays by which the
Atlantic coast is indented, were having the benefits of communication
extended to them from Bett's Cove, in Notre Dame
Bay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>The benefits of these trips were so greatly appreciated by the
fishermen in the northern parts of the island that the department
arranged for regular fortnightly services during the winter from
Bonne Bay along the west coast to the top of the island, and thence
down the east coast as far as Canada Bay. On the other side the
steamers which carried the mails northward from St. John's to the
settlements on Notre Dame Bay, also conveyed bags for the settled
districts in White Bay. These were sent forward monthly from
Bett's Cove. Thus was completed the system of coastal service
by which every part of the island was brought into communication
with the capital of the colony.</p>

<p>On the larger and more thickly settled bays, it was obviously
impossible for the steamers which sailed from St. John's to stop
at any but the more populous villages, and within each of these
bays smaller craft plied to the less important settlements. In
1881, there were eight such sailing vessels in the service of the post
office: one each in Bonavista and Trinity Bays, three in Placentia
Bay, two in Fortune Bay, and one which effected the exchange of
mails at Harbour Breton. In Conception Bay, where there were
two towns and several villages a steamer was employed.</p>

<p>But though the settlements in Newfoundland were at this
period practically all on the coasts, and depended mainly on seacraft
for the means of communication, the conveyance of mails to
the northern settlements was in the winter one of great danger and
difficulty.</p>

<p>As early as 1863, it was determined to make the experiment of
serving these settlements by couriers who should travel over an
overland route. In February of that year, Smith McKay undertook
the delivery by land, so far as that was possible, to Greenspond,
on the stretch of coast between Bonavista and Notre Dame Bay,
and to Fogo and Twillingate, islands in Notre Dame Bay. The
success attending this trip induced the postmaster general to make
a contract for three trips each winter.</p>

<p>The government also planned the construction of a road, which
would make communication easier between the northern outports
and St. John's. The work was entered upon with vigour, the
reports of progress making an interesting feature of the annual
papers of the legislature. In 1868, a serviceable road was constructed
to Gander Bay, an inlet of Notre Dame Bay, whence the
mails were conveyed to the important villages of Twillingate and
Fogo by sailing vessel.</p>

<p>In 1870 the road was complete. It was estimated to be 210<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
miles in length. There were six relay stations on the route, and
ten men employed in the conveyance. The course pursued by the
courier took him from Harbour Grace, his starting point, down the
shore of Conception Bay; thence along the isthmus separating
Trinity from Placentia Bay, serving the settlements on each side
of the isthmus. From the top of the isthmus, the road maintained
a northerly direction, running generally parallel with the Atlantic
coast, as far as Greenspond, from which point it turned westward
across the country to Gander Bay.</p>

<p>The postal accommodation on the peninsula of Avalon was
greatly augmented by the completion of the railway between St.
John's and Harbour Grace in 1884. On January 1, 1885, all the
principal offices at the bottom of Conception Bay were supplied
with mails daily, and Heart's Content and other offices on
Trinity Bay had their mails three times a week. The extension
of the branch to Placentia in October 1888 gave that village the
benefit of an expeditious service three times a week.</p>

<p>The northern settlements were given the benefit of the more
speedy service afforded by the railway. The winter arrangements
were expedited and extended. In 1870, when this service was put
on a settled footing, ten couriers were employed. In 1890, their
number was increased to fifty-four. The mails for the northern
districts were despatched from St. John's by railway to Broad
Cove station, where they were taken over by the couriers. Their
greater number enabled the couriers, not only to shorten their
relays, but to establish a trunk line to the settlements of Hall's
Bay and Little Bay on Notre Dame Bay, with branch lines running
to the more important settlements to the east and west. The overlapping
of the western and northern courier systems at White
Bay gave the dwellers in those remote regions the opportunity
of replying to their letters without loss of time.</p>

<p>Communication was established with the settlers on the
Labrador coast in 1875. Previous to that time, mails were sent as
the opportunity was afforded by sailing vessels visiting that coast.
In that year, a regular fortnightly service was put in operation,
the steamer by which the mails were carried connecting with the
steamer on the northern route.</p>

<p>The "Ariel," which was first employed on this route having
been lost in September of the same year, its place was taken by the
"Walrus," whose work gave much satisfaction to the department.
In 1881, an arrangement was made by which the steamer running
on the northern route from St. John's extended its trip to Battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Harbour, where it was met by the Labrador vessel, which served all
the settlements as far north as Nain.</p>

<p>A money order system was an early adjunct to the primary
functions of the post office. In 1862 the postmaster general of
Prince Edward Island proposed on exchange with Newfoundland,
on the basis of the arrangement between that colony and Canada.
The postmaster general, Delaney, was eager to accept the proposition,
but there were delays, and it was not until 1864 that an
exchange was adopted. This exchange was not with Prince Edward
Island, however, but with Great Britain.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1865 exchanges were established with
Canada, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and in 1867 with
New Brunswick. In 1866 a domestic exchange was set on foot, the
system embracing the twelve leading post offices besides St. John's.</p>

<p>Delaney endeavoured to come to an arrangement of the same
character with the United States, but the department at Washington
was unable to adopt the proposition at the time, and it was
only in 1876 that arrangements were completed for an exchange
through the intermediation of the Canadian service.</p>

<p>The comparative lack of banking facilities in the island gave
the money order system an unusual utility. At the end of 1865,
the amount of the money orders exchanged was $13,112. In the
first ten years the business expended to $58,712; in twenty years,
its volume had increased thirteen-fold, being $174,740.</p>

<p>Though a steam vessel could make the voyage from the shores
of Cape Breton to the south-west coast of Newfoundland in a few
hours, the course of communication between the island and Canada
and the United States was lamentably infrequent. As late as
1895, mails were exchanged with these countries no more frequently
than once a week.</p>

<p>The completion, however, of the railway across the island in the
autumn of 1896, changed the aspect of affairs. Trains travelled
from St. John's to Port aux Basques, three times a week, touching
in their course the bottoms of the great bays, which mark the
coast lines on either side of the island. On each of the bays,
steamers plied in close connection with the trains, thus giving all
the settlements of the island the maximum of benefit to be obtained
from a single line of railway. A steamer ran from the western
end of the line at Port aux Basques to North Sydney in Cape Breton,
and by a night's voyage, Newfoundland was brought into connection
with the system of communications on the continent of
North America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>The exchange of mails between Canada and Newfoundland
remained at a frequency of three times a week until 1914 when it
was increased to a daily service each way; and the inland service
has been so improved that there is no district in the island, however
remote, has not at least a weekly communication with the capital,
while nearly all the towns and villages of any importance exchange
mails with St. John's every day.</p>

<p>In the sphere of telegraphy the progress has not been less
marked. Unlike Canada and the United States, but as in the
mother country and most other countries, the telegraphs are under
the control of the government, and administered by the postmaster
general. Until 1901, this was not the case. By a concession
granted by the legislature in 1854, the Anglo-American Telegraph
Company obtained the exclusive privilege of communicating
abroad by telegraphy, and of erecting and operating lines within
the colony.</p>

<p>The system established under this privilege was naturally
confined to the more populous districts, and indeed, it covered
little beyond the peninsula of Avalon. The outlying parts of the
island, embracing all the settlements on bays north of Trinity,
and west of Placentia Bays were, in general, without the means of
communicating with the capital by telegraph.</p>

<p>The company turned a deaf ear to all appeals which did not
promise an augmentation of their profits. They had no objection
to the government running lines to the remoter regions, as such
messages as would be sent to St. John's from those parts must
pass over the company's lines when they came within the system
marked out by the company for themselves in virtue of their
monopoly. The government would, in that case, bear the loss
entailed by the maintenance of these lines, and the company
would absorb the additional revenue arising from the transmission
of these extra-territorial messages over their lines.</p>

<p>With the development of the fishing, mining and lumbering
industries in all parts of the island, the extension of the means of
telegraphic communication beyond the peninsula of Avalon became
a necessity, and the government had no option but to provide
these means, wherever the importance of the districts seemed to
demand it.</p>

<p>Thus there grew up two systems, an inner and an outer one,
the latter depending on the former for the means of access to the
capital of the island. All messages to and from the outer system
were subject to a double charge, for transmission over both systems.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
While messages circulating within the peninsula of Avalon had the
advantage of the moderate charge of twenty-five cents for ten
words, messages from outside the peninsula were subject to double
that rate.</p>

<p>The government were helpless in the matter. They endeavoured
vainly to come to terms with the company by which they might
erect a line of their own from St. John's to Whitbourne, a village
about sixty miles from St. John's, at which the lines of the outer
system connected with those belonging to the company. The
company, however, stood firmly on the letter of the bond, and it
was not until the approach of the time when the monopoly, which
was for a period of fifty years, would expire, that they became at
all unbending.</p>

<p>An event of far-reaching importance took place in November
1901 in the arrival of Marconi to experiment as to the possibility of
opening communication across the Atlantic by his wireless system
of telegraphy. Early in December, he caught at his station on
Signal Hill near St. John's some signals sent out from the Lizards
in Cornwall, thereby establishing a new agency for conducting
communication between Europe and America. When he had
assured himself of the success of his experiments, he set about
obtaining a site for a permanent station on Cape Spear. But no
sooner had the Anglo-American company become aware of his
intentions than they notified him that his proposed measures would
be an infringement of their monopoly.</p>

<p>Thus blocked, Marconi resolved to return to England, but an
opportune invitation from the Canadian government led him to
turn his attention to the advantages that might be obtained on the
eastern coast of Cape Breton. He was not long in selecting a site
at Table Head, near Glace Bay, where he erected a station, and
has demonstrated the feasibility of wireless communication across
the Atlantic for commercial purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
